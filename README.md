Abstract:
To unfold the tremendous amount of audiovisual data uploaded daily to social media platforms, effective topic modeling techniques are needed. Existing work tends to apply variants of topic models on text data sets. In this paper,  we aim at developing a topic extractor on video transcriptions. The model improves coherence by exploiting neural word embeddings through a graph-based clustering method. Unlike typical topic models, this approach works without knowing the true number of topics. Experimental results on the real-life multimodal dataset MuSe-CaR demonstrates that our approach extracts coherent and meaningful topics, outperforming baseline methods. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrate the generalisability of our approach on a pure text review dataset.





Overview of this repository:
- visuals:
      This subfolder contains all graphs and scores from the topic models.

- src:
      This folder contains all the python source code to repeat the studies,
      use the requirements file to download all necessary libraries.

- data:
      All pre-calculated topic models and training set of MuSe - CaR
      is saved in this subfolder.
