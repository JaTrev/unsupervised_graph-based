# Unsupervised Graph-based Topic Modeling from Video Transcriptions
This is the repository of the paper
"Unsupervised Graph-based Topic Modeling from Video Transcriptions"
by Jason Thies, Lukas Stappen, Gerhard Hagerer, Bj√∂rn W. Schuller, and Georg Groh.

In this paper,  we aim at developing a topic extractor on video transcriptions. 
The model improves coherence by exploiting neural word embeddings through a graph-based clustering method. 
Unlike typical topic models, this approach works without knowing the true number of topics. 
Experimental results on the real-life multimodal dataset MuSe-CaR demonstrates that our approach extracts coherent and 
meaningful topics, outperforming baseline methods. 
Furthermore, we successfully demonstrate the generalisability of our approach on a pure text review dataset.



Overview of this repository:
- visuals:
      This folder contains all graphs and scores from the topic models.

- src:
      This folder contains all the python source code for the study,
      use the requirements file to download all necessary libraries.

- data:
    This folder includes the training data set (including the labels) of MuSe - CaR 
    as well as the CitySearch Car Review data set (training and test set) from 
    ([http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mehrbod/RR/][http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mehrbod/RR/]). 
    All existing pre-calculated models are in this folder.
