 Always a fun place ... the food is deeelish ! 
 The staff is n't the friendliest or most competent , and I am stickler for service , but everything else about this place makes up for it . 
 Great for groups , great for a date , great for early brunch or a nightcap . 
 Another great place to take out-of-towners ! 
 : ) 
 I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent ! ! 
 The service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served . 
 The waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing . 
 After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : Where are you from ...maybe you dont know how things work in America ...and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on . 
 We did tip , I guess the model just wanted more and complained to the manager . 
 The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place . 
 My friends and I showed up on a Sat . 
 night without a reservation , we had to wait at the bar for a little while , but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience . 
 Bar was a little bit crowded , but these five girls know how to have fun ! ! it was a little hard to understand the waitress and she seemed to have little patience with our questions . 
 We had to ask the manager and he was very helpful .Food was great and so was music ! 
 We will come back ! ! ! 
 Busy . Crow ded . 
 Sexy . 
 Great for large groups and celebrations - our SUPER HAPPY waiter was the entertainment of the evening . 
 Would n't have it any other way ... made great recommendations and gave out group the full treatment . 
 Food was average but tasty . 
 Dessert - ca n't be missed , so save room ! ! ! 
 The bartender on my most recent visit was so incredibly rude that I will never go back . 
 He asked if we wanted change when we paid him for our pitcher of Sangria we asked for a couple of dollars back ( gave him $ 30 for $ 25 pitcher - still leaving him w $ 3 tip ) he laughed said are you serious , then got us the change put it on the bar asked us if we were from out of town . 
 No. Then asked if there was a problem with the sangria . 
 No. He stood there looking us up down then walked away . 
 We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria , but facing away from the bar when we turned back around , the $ 2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it . 
 So rude . 
 This was the worst dining experience I 've ever had . 
 The only friendly staff member was the guy at the bar . 
 The man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7 , then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving ( mean while there were boths open all around ) . 
 When we were finally seated our waitress came by twice-1 for our order and 2-for our check . 
 My turkey burger was not cooked at all , my friends salmon was completely raw . 
 Horrible food and Horrible service . 
 I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE HEARTLAND BREWERY . 
 ALWAYS full with tourists ( especially because of it 's close proximity to Rockefeller Cente r ) . 
 But this place is a well-oiled machine so they know what they 're doing . 
 Ive been here a bunch of times now and the service is always outstanding . 
 The food is above average for midtown and sligtly better than some of the other Heartland Breweries in the city . 
 This place is worth going even if only for their beer . 
 The seasonal beers are fabulous ! ! Try the pumpkin ale in the fall ... it 's my favorite . 
 Heartland Brewery is by far one of the best places in NYC to make new friends and catch up with old ones . 
 No dress codes , no attitudes , plenty of comfort companionship , a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown . 
 So much more than the usual bar food , go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand-crafted beers . 
 Heartland Brewery is a great way to start or finish your day . 
 David , Daytona Beach , FL 
 What a great place ! 
 Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant . 
 A cool bar with great food , and tons of excellent beer . 
 And even with it 's Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too ! 
 Loved it ! 
 This is the perfect spot for meeting friends , having lunch , dinner , pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks ! 
 ( Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer ! ! ! 
 Guaranteed to be a tasty experience ! ) Excellent spot for holiday get togethers with co-workers or friends that you have n't seen in a while . 
 I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED ! 
 All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends ! 
 Go there once and oh yes ...you will go back ...you will ... 
 My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time ! 
 It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY--I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country . 
 They tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter , so i'm looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it.Check this place out ! 
 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ! ! ! ! ! 
 I just read Mocaramel 's review and felt compelled to respond . 
 I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna . 
 Over the years the host , Vittorio , and his crew , have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does , it amazing he 's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor . 
 I 've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years : A new Jazz Bar , the most fantastic Dining Garden , the Best Thin Crust Pizzas , and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for ( these are not your average lasagnas ) ! 
 I lOVE THIS PLACE ! 
 Keep up the good work guys ! 
 Very romantic fires - I 've literally spent hours at Lanterna , drinking wine from their extensive wine and enjoying the ambience . 
 Reasonable prices . 
 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for a first date . 
 Try the chocolate mud cake ( warmed ) with 2 scoops of dulce de leche gelato . 
 WOW . 
 Having hunted around for a quiet , romantic , yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot . 
 Quite simply it 's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tra nquility . 
 The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough ( both in quantity AND quality ) . 
 I will be going back and heartily recommend it ! 
 I absolutely Loved this place . 
 My friends spoke so much about it for months , I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in . 
 this is can became on e of the NY Italian Food fare institutions . 
 I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation . 
 The wine list is also really nice . 
 Ballato 's is consistently delicious authentic italian food . 
 some of the best i have had in the city . the ambience is cozy and secluded with wonderful art on the walls . 
 i love the pics of andy warhol when he used to frequent the place ( he painted the ballato 's sign in the window ) . 
 Emilio , the owner , is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go . 
 Going to Ballato 's is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen , an absolute delight ! 
 Yes . It is what it is let 's all scream loud and give credit to this Old fashion Italian restaurant ina suburbed area of houston street .If this place would be in midtown or somwhere fancy ...forget it ! ! would double it 's value . 
 I have n't eat a lamb chop as delicious as that,the salads are really nice dressed with lemon and extra virgnin olive oil . 
 If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines ,please check their wine list . 
 Covers all of the best area of Italy and many are the selections ...hops ..Lenny Kravitz just walked in ...well i know why is such a good place to eat and relax ! 
 Bravissimo ! ! 
 I have known about this secret for the last 13 years , Emilio( the Godfather ) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices . 
 If you go , try the marinara sauce , the mozzarella en Carozza is mmmmmmmm . .... everything is just delicious . 
 Check out the secret back room . 
 Old school meets New world . 
 I pray it stays open forever . 
 Thank You Emilio . 
 Ciao Bella 
 The food there are sastifying . 
 I often go there to eat with my family . 
 Seating is ok even though sometimes there 's alot of people . 
 The noodle and rices dishes taste great . 
 If you want some roast duck , pork or chicken on rice with ginger , try them out ! 
 They are located in the middle of Chinatown ! 
 The service is ok but could be better . 
 Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment . 
 The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can . 
 The food is prepared quickly and efficiently . 
 And it all comes at a very reasonable price ( congee , noodles , and rice dishes are no more than $ 3-6 each ) . 
 The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well . 
 This place is always very crowded and popular . 
 Obviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong , it actually means Great Prosperity . 
 The food here does a great service to the name ( Cantonese that is .. . ) . 
 I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork . 
 This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it . 
 Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh , a delicious and sweet tasting bread . 
 This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city . 
 I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee ( rice porridge ) . 
 It 's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend . 
 It 's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone . 
 Quick and friendly service . 
 This is one of the best comfort food places in the city . 
 It 's somewhere you can eat and be happy . 
 Went to Cafe Spice with 4 of my friends on a saturday night.We were greeted promptly by the waiter who was very nice and cordial.She was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about Indian food . 
 We were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry . 
 The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates . 
 We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun ( dessert ) recommended by the waiter . 
 I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others . 
 Went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers . 
 We could n't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hinting that we 're taking too much time -- amazing , we just sat down . 
 The entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt . 
 In terms of the food itself -- nothing special , we limited ourselves to several appetizers . 
 Yet paired with such rude service , would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there . 
 If just to drop in , quickly stuff yourself and jet out -- to keep their turn-over . 
 Perhaps . 
 I 've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times , it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square . 
 To sum it up : Service varies from good to mediorce , depending on which waiter you get ; generally it is just average Ok . Seating is always prompt , though the restaurant does fill up in the evening . 
 Food is usually very good , though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders . 
 As many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time . 
 The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date . 
 This place is great . 
 I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of . 
 The waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal ! 
 Service was prompt , friendly and great . 
 Slightly on the pricey side but worth it ! 
 The food here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it . 
 I like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing . 
 The service varys from day to day - sometimes they 're very nice , and sometimes not . 
 The kitchen however , is almost always slow . 
 Also , specify if you like your food spicy - its rather bland if you do n't . 
 The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation , so a casual lunch here would probably be best . 
 This restaurant used to be pretty decent . 
 Over time , the food quality has decreased substan tially , it is a lot less crowded than it used to , and the service must definitely be part of the reason . 
 Everything , from the soft bread , soggy salad , and 50 minute wait time , with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food . 
 I would not recommend this place to anyone . 
 Oh yes , and they lie on the phone , claiming they have seating in the garden , then of course the seats are not available . 
 I have been to Casimir over 5 times and I have always had a great time there . 
 The food is great and reasonably priced . 
 I have tried to make reservations , but both times , the hostess did n't have my name . 
 If the weather is nice , try to snag an outside table . 
 The staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often . 
 I 've been there a few times , and I usually end up sitting next to some pretty odd people . 
 Odd for Ave B , not just odd , The place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least . 
 Aside from the bearded , courdoroy blazer professor type with the NYU student he 's sleeping with that week , you see a strange mix of hipsters , frat boys , Will Smith types who need to be told they are black , bitter cougars who cant understand why they arent married yet .... 
 Just an odd group . 
 Anyway , the food is good , the price is right and they have a decent wine list . 
 So , if yo really do n't care who is sittingnext to you , which is about 2 inches away , I would say try it . 
 Casimir is almost always packed , but I 've never had to wait more than 15 minutes for a table . 
 Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room ( no matter what the size of your party ) , the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters - you 'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you 're in . 
 The waitstaff are all very busy , it 's not outstanding service , but I 've never been dealt with rudely . 
 Of course the reason its so packed is because the food is so delicious ! 
 I 've had oysters , lamb , steak , and duck- all were well-prepared and tender . 
 The specials are usually quite good too . 
 Great romantic place for a date ( try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close ! ) . 
 I found this restaurant to be one that truly values its patrons . 
 Service and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money . 
 Obv caviar is top of the line but the rest of the menu is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so manydifferent varietys . 
 The tastes makes your mouth water for more . 
 Waitstaff is great , very attentive . 
 Wine list is not huge but def well selected . 
 I recommend that you try this hidden spot which will surely blowup very soon 
 My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent . 
 From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff , I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it . 
 Considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time , the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and rela xed . 
 I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service . 
 My wife and I were in NYC celebrating our 30th anniversary . 
 We went to this restaurant based on prior internet comments . 
 We were not disappointed . 
 The food was terrific and the service classy , attentive , without being overbearing . 
 Somewhat pricey but what the heck . 
 I recommend to anyone who wants to dress up and impress the lady . 
 Went with mommy ( the only person who could afford taking me here ) . 
 We had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses ! 
 Great people watching as others do the same to you . 
 Definitely a once a year treat that I look forward to around the holidays ! 
 I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date . 
 The place was quiet and delightful . 
 Service was good and food is wonderful . 
 I did not try the caviar but I tried their salmon and crab salad ( they are all good ) It is definitely a good spot for snacks and chat . 
 I visit New Green Bo when I have money or when I am broke . 
 I recommend the jelly fish , drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings , certainly the stir fry blue crab . 
 The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice . 
 Of course , it is crowded but who cares . 
 Authentic Shanghai style and I cannot recommend a better Shanghai place in New York . 
 One of the more authentic Shanghainese restaurants in the US definitely the best in Manhattan Chinatown . 
 Was reading other reviews and thought -- if all you order is chow fun then of course it 's greasy and awful ( and not even Shanghainese ) ... agreed , the ambience is lacking . 
 But the traditional items -- yellow eel , eggplant , mock chicken , fried juicy buns , etc . ( which most tourists do n't order ) -- are prepared with traditional flavor , harboring a semi-sweet , juicy taste . 
 Yeah Shanghai is also great but not quite as good -- they use the same amount of salt but without sweetness to balance out . 
 Lived in Shanghai most of my life and thought the food was comparable to the flagship Green Bo restaurant there . 
 Okay , so I never write but there does n't seem to fair balance of positive to negative reviews concerning Green Bo and it 's time to speak up - I live in Chinatown . 
 I live on the street this place is on . 
 I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance . 
 And the soup bombs here , lovingly called Pork Dumplings with Soup ( ha ! ) are an experiance . 
 Wonton dough filled with gently steamed and seasoned pork are common but add this amazing soup to the wonton , seal it and serve it steaming hot and the dumpling becomes new again ...this place is amazing for those dumplings alone but try the wine chicken and the scallion pancakes as well . 
 This restaurant was way overhyped . 
 My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily . 
 Okay-i do n't mind the oily part ( cause most are cooked that way ) but it was way too bland . 
 The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary . 
 I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try . 
 The filet mignon dish was superb ! 
 I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices . 
 It 's a small cute restaurant . 
 Raga 's is a romantic , cozy restaurant . 
 The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations . 
 It is also extremely well priced . 
 The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive . 
 The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines . 
 This is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed . 
 Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem ! 
 These innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible . 
 Pair you food with the excellent beers on tap or their well priced wine list . 
 We had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning . 
 Off the beaten path , this jewel of a restaurant shines just one block away from the plethora of 6th street Indian restaurants . 
 Raga stands out with an interesting fusion of French and Indian cooking . 
 We were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the manager Tony Gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections . 
 From beginning appetizers , the scallops were incredible , to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sor bet , we were delighted by the taste sensations . 
 I am not sure if I would call the food here Indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be French with an Indian or exotic touch . 
 I guess the way my friends and I described it was The French Colonies . 
 The food is delicious and beautifully prepared along with the friendly and personable service . 
 Prices are not cheap , but not expensive but the meal is worth every penny . 
 One thing I liked about this place is that I never felt rushed or pressured to give up my table ot incoming guests . 
 Be sure to reserve in advanc e ! 
 Been going here since it opened have seen the quality value decrease considerably . 
 The portions are now very small , the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic . 
 Recommended : appetizer calamari , beautifully deep-fried , but served with 2 awful sauces--ask for an alternative sauce . 
 Best dish is nori-wrapped tuna . 
 If you live outside the neighborhood , do n't bother ! 
 I read the other review and have to say I had the opposite experience here last Sunday . 
 I loved it and will be back soon . 
 I went with 5 friends and we lingered at the table for a bit and did n't feel rushed at all even though there was a wait . 
 Just do n't do it . 
 Three strikes and this restaurant is out . 
 Everything that happened was not even up to mediocre . 
 They did not have mayo nnaise , forgot our toast , left out ingredients ( ie cheese in an omelet ) , below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it . 
 And at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our table by knocking over a glass of water . 
 I 've been here 3 times for lunch and it is one of my favorites in the city . 
 The service is outstanding and my crab-cake eggs benedict could not have been better . 
 My friend ordered some of their special sushi rolls which had excellent presentation and tasted great ! 
 There was a long wait for a table outside , but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice . 
 This restaurant is such a great place . 
 I have been here a few times for dinner , once for brunch and twice for lunch . 
 I have enjoyed everything I have ever gotten and the fish is so fresh and always prepared in a great way . 
 The sushi is also great ! 
 The banana tower is an amazing dessert as well . 
 This restaurant is a wonderful place to go many times and it is reasonably priced . 
 After a seafood craving , i checked citysearch and chose to go to Fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info . 
 Friendly and informative staff , very attentive and prompt raw bar service . 
 Good wine selection as well as tap beers at happy hour prices until 7pm . 
 i will definitely go back ! ! Sports on flat screen tv above bar kept me entertained through 3 rounds . 
 Very good value 
 All I can say is $ 2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest oysters you 'll find in the city , though the quality is some of the best . 
 I did n't take a look at the rest menu , but the oysters were fantastic . 
 There was a great deal for 6 Blue Point oysters and a beer or glass of wine for $ 8 ! 
 You wo n't find that anywhere in Manhattan . 
 The atmosphere is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon . 
 $ 2 pints and tasty oysters is a great way to go .......you wo n't be dissapointed . 
 Came looking for this place because I heard good things . 
 Went inside and I started to get excited . 
 The menu looked good , except for offering the Chilean Sea Bass , but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside . 
 Whem asked , we had to ask more detailed questions so that we knew what the specials were . 
 Finally got our food after waiting a long time for oysters , does n't take that long to shuck 'em , the place is n't that big , and it was OK . Looked good , lacked in seasoning , maybe that 's why they leave the Old Bay on the Table , to season everything yourself . 
 Great idea and base for restaurant , but work on the details , people who think this was good need to go back to the shore towns and rethink what it should have tasted like . 
 Went on a 3 day oyster binge , with Fish bringing up the closing , and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended , because it was so great ! 
 You ca n't go wrong here . 
 When I visited my friend who lives in the Upper Eastside , she recommended that we go to this restaurant . 
 At first I was slightly skeptical because it was a sushi restaurant in the middle of NYC . 
 Boy was I wrong ! 
 The food was great and the service was even better . 
 The best part of the experience was knowing that the manager ( a bubbly , friendly young woman with a great smile ) truly cared about how we were doing . 
 I would definently recommend this restaurant . 
 The worst excuse for Japanese food I 've ever encountered . 
 The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water . 
 The sushi was awful ! 
 The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard . 
 Furthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting . 
 The fish was adequate , but inexpertly sliced . 
 It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine . 
 Do n't be fooled by crowds of people . 
 The service is awful . 
 This place is not worth the prices . 
 Also , do n't plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it 's not on the menu , you ca n't have it . 
 Great sushi experience . 
 Nice value . 
 Unique apppetizers . 
 Try sushimi cucumber roll . 
 When I saw that their website had a link to da Ciro in Napoli , I knew there was going to be good pizza ! 
 Their Margarita is best I 've had since I 've returned from Naples ! 
 The tomatoes , the crust , the mozzarella--everything is perfect ! 
 Brava La Pizza Fresca ! 
 I came here with a friend and we both had really delicious pastas ... mine was pesto linguini with shrimp and hers linguini with a pomodoro sauce and lobster ... both were really great , but came out a little warm ( not hot ) . 
 However , looking at the table next to ours , we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza , which looked PERRRRRRRRRFECT . 
 Still , nice service and the desserts were great ... Lovely tiramisu and a DELICIOUS molten chocolate cake that was incredibly rich and wonderful . 
 Nice restaurant overall , with classic upscale Italian decor . 
 great wine list ( italian ) , good food , service was INITIALLY fine . 
 After the main course came , we did n't see our waiter for at least 40 MINUTES ! 
 ( food was delivered by a busboy , not waiter ) We got no cheese offered for the pasta , our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal , when we would have easily spent another $ 20 on wine . 
 We could not catch our waiter 's eye , and he ignored us . 
 This was on a Tuesday night . 
 The table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived . 
 We laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent tip , which was generous , I feel . 
 kalbi and nebbiolo do work together . 
 i know we 're talking about italian here ... but such remark depicts the worldly somelier of LPF , who is a true gourmand savvy not only in wine but in the basics of good eat . 
 LPF 's simply delicious and fantasically authentic neopolitan style pizza is excellente ...my usual 1st course that can easily turn into the 2nd and 3rd . 
 word of advice , save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you 've had the tiramisu . 
 Our second time at Sala Thai was pleas ant . 
 We were a group of 8 and well seved . 
 My fish was delicious in an incredible curry sauce . 
 Acceptable prices . 
 I 'll be back soon . 
 Everything at Sala Thai is tasty and well-portioned . 
 The calamari comes with an incredible sauce , and the duck noodles are yummy as well . 
 The ambience is less than special ; however , if you 're looking for a filling , above-average Thai dinner , this is the place to go ! 
 I really liked this place . 
 Everything I had was good , and I 'm a eater . 
 It was pretty inexpensive too . 
 this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices . 
 the pad se ew chicken was del icious , however the pad thai was far too oily . 
 i would just ask for no oil next time . 
 I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. Being serious sushi lovers , we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action . 
 I asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if I like Uni . ( For those of you who do n't know , Uni is Sea Urchin in Japanese , which happens to be my favorite . ) He served me an Uni Hand roll , which I never had before , and let me tell you ...IT WAS HEAVEN ! 
 Aside from the Sea Urchin , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail , Boton Shrimp , Blue Fin Torro ( Fatty Tuna ) , Sea Eel , etc . 
 The sake menu should not be overlooked ! 
 All in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city . 
 Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll . 
 Average . Completely Average . 
 If you 're in town , it 's worth searching for another place . 
 The service , however , was a bright flower in a garden . 
 I was n't there for the Half-Price Saturday Night Special , but Tuesday Night . 
 Perhaps it was an off night , but it was suprisingly average for a 9.3 rating . 
 This is the first time Citysearch did't call it right . 
 I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose . 
 It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy , crea my , and slightly buttery . 
 The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned . 
 The rice to fish ration was also good--they did n't try to overpack the rice . 
 We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it . 
 We were fans of the half-price Saturday night option until some inedible squid during a recent visit . 
 They kindly brought us more to see if it was better , but it was not ! 
 The miso soup lacked flavor and the fish was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past . 
 We were sorry to check them off our list as we had enjoyed and recommended the place in the past . 
 Average to good Thai food , but terrible delivery . 
 I 've waited over one hour for food . 
 They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice . 
 A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner ? 
 The food arrived 20 minutes after I called , cold and soggy . 
 A friend from Seattle and I went on a Thursday night around 8:30 . 
 Everything was wonderful ; food , drinks , staff , mileau . 
 I would highly recommend this place ! 
 There are many Thai places in the city but so far Toons is # 1 . 
 Their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic . 
 The price is reasonable although the service is poor . 
 Toons has recently been redone , so it 's now a very attractive space . 
 The food 's as good as ever . 
 In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food , this is one of the best spots . 
 For authentic Thai food , look no further than Toons . 
 Ive been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before , and Toons is by far the best Thai food Ive had ( except for my mom 's of course ) . 
 Try the Pad Thai , or sample anything on the appetizer menu...they 're all delicious . 
 VT is what baby pizzas hope to be when they grow up . 
 They sit and read about the exploits of a VT pizza : its deliciousness ; its flaky , tender crust ; the perfection of the tomato sauce and cheese combinations ; the supreme pepperoni . 
 They pray to their Food Gods to make them into a good pizza like VT 's . 
 Some baby pizzas get their wish . 
 Others have to go to other restaurants and feel sad until they 're eaten . 
 Yeah , sometimes the service can be slow . 
 If that 's a problem , go to McDonald 's and destroy your insides . 
 Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best , freshly baked bread ! 
 Veal Parmigana - Better than Patsy 's ! 
 Much more reasonably priced too ! 
 I take all my NYC guests to VT 's . 
 This is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for take-out pizza . 
 Because of the delicate thin crust , take-out pies get soggy in their boxes . 
 Try their plain pizza with fresh garlic or eggp lant . 
 Their eggplant is so delicate , sweet tender ! 
 Also , top the meal with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu . 
 Waiters are slow but sweet . 
 I 've been living in the Columbia University area for about 10 years with 3 kids - now in their teens . 
 This is one of our all-time favorite . 
 I 'd call it an 'italian dinner ' . 
 Nice Family owned traditional restaurant . 
 Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order . 
 I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken . 
 Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you 're with . 
 I did n't expect much from this tiny establishment , but after passing it up so many times , I took a chance 1 night tried it w some friends . 
 We were pleasantly surprised . 
 The ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca . 
 Do n't expect over-the-top service - this is a small place w a small staff , but they were friendly very accommodating , when they could be found . 
 The bruscetta is a bit soggy , but the salads were fresh , included a nice mix of greens ( not iceberg ) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen . 
 A word to the wise - the Hoboken health inspector clued me to his findings that this is THE cleanest restaurant in town . 
 Restaurant snobs need not bother , this is a small , neighborhood kind of place . 
 My husband and I ate here after reading reviews here as well as hobokeni .com , 
 and we were thouroughly disapointed . 
 The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry , inedible chicken with terrible sauce . 
 After complaining about the chicken dish , the manager came over to tell us that , no one had ever complained before , and that we just did n't know what the dish was supposed to taste like . 
 I 've never been treated so rudely . 
 Save your money and do n't waste your calories , go to Margharita 's on Washington Street instead , they have amazing food and the BEST service . 
 Katz 's deli is a great NY experience . 
 Is just the way it was in days gone by . 
 Fabulous old decor the best food we had on our recent trip to NYC . Kids are welcome--the hotdogs are great ! 
 The sandwhiches are out-of-this world ! 
 The waitresses are nice--also you can just get counter service sit . 
 There is a real gallery of stars that have visited . 
 A wonderful place ! 
 While there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich , Katz 's has a charm about it . 
 It can be a little confusing as to where one goes to order , but once the food is ordered , you are in for a treat . 
 If you are a vegetarian , this really is n't a good place to go . 
 The corned beef was tender and melted in my mouth . 
 The pickles were great addition. 
 I would have gotten some cole slaw and a knish if my stomach had more space . 
 Katz 's has been a NYC original for over 100 years . 
 If you are in search of the most authentic NYC deli experience look no further than the famous and historic Katz 's Deli down on the Lower East Side . 
 Pastrami or corned beef are juicy and piled high ( ask for extra rye bread ) . 
 The servers give you some sample slices of your order while you wait ( shortly I might add ) . 
 Kosher dills are the perfect compliment for your unforgetable sandwich and they give you plenty of them . 
 Try the hot dogs too , they 're snappy and delicious . 
 If you are a carnivore , come hungry and you will leave more satisfied than you have ever been . 
 Being from the south , there are n't any good delis in my area and while watching Foods across America on PBS I found out about Katz 's Deli . 
 I knew upon visiting NYC that I wanted to try an orginal deli . 
 I was glad I did . 
 The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down , it was a pleasurable experience . 
 Look foward to trying the Ruben upon returning . 
 It will be on my to do list the next visit to NYC . 
 We were very surprised by how good the food was on our first visit here on a Sunday night . 
 Service was excellent , and the AC worked very well too ( thank God , it was hot ! ) . 
 Decor is nice and minimalist , food simple yet very well presented and cooked , and the wine list matches the food very well . 
 Even better , they know how to cook French classics like Steak au Poivre and Onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it . 
 Black and blue , that 's all I need ! Quality of the meat was excellent , I might add . 
 Frites were delicious if a bit on the thick side . 
 Service was very good and warm . 
 Overall I was impressed and will return , it 's a great QPR ( Quality to Price Ratio ) . 
 Moules were excellent , lobster ravioli was VERY salty ! 
 Took my mom for Mother 's Day , and the maitre d' was pretty rude . 
 Told us to sit anywhere , and when we sat he said the table was reserved . 
 Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting . 
 Tiny dessert was $ 8.00 ...just plain overpriced for what it is . 
 Three page wine menu , one page entree and horedevous . 
 A very inviting restaurant , with friendly service . 
 Great selection of wine , and seafood . 
 Did I mention the wine ? 
 This place blew me away ...by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side . 
 The wine list is extensive and impressive . 
 LOVE the atmosphere - felt like I was in Paris . 
 The mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert ...definitely going to be back very soon . 
 Great spot , whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner . 
 Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months . 
 The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices . 
 Have been several times and it never dissapoints . 
 Have frequented ' ino for several years and the food remains excellent . 
 Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $ 10 . 
 The large selection of bruschettas , paninis , tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating . 
 ( The asparagus , truffle oil , parmesan bruschetta is a winner ! ) Wine list is extensive without being over-priced . 
 Be sure to try the seasonal , and always del icious , specials . 
 Definitely a neighborhood favorite . 
 I ate here for the first time and absolutely loved it ! 
 The restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a table quickly . 
 The bruschetta and panini 's are so yummy ! 
 I plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of bruschetta , panini 's . .... 
 I do n't live in NY but my best friend does . 
 And when I visit her I make it a point to eat at 'Ino at least once daily if not once for the whole trip . 
 It is the best hidden spot there and I rave about it to everyone . 
 I 've had to wait only a few times during lunch but this place is definitely worth the wait . 
 I wish I lived there as I would eat at this place as often as possibl e ! 
 We went to Ino for Valentines . 
 We were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait . 
 As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited . 
 When we sat , we got great and fast service . 
 The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes . 
 Make sure you try this place as often as you can . 
 The service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but I have never been treated rudely . 
 There are a few Italian employees who may not speak the best English but for me that adds to the experience . 
 We had a 3 hour brunch- they definitely do not rush you - and they kept the unlimited mimosas flowing the whole time . 
 The dinner menu is diverse and top-notch as well . 
 I go at least 3 times a month and have never been disappointed . 
 Our tiny table for two ( dinner plates hung over edge ) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic . 
 I was back-to-back with the diner at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again . 
 We were told that they were booked solid and no other table was available . 
 I asked for seltzer with lime , no ice . 
 Got club soda , filled with ice , no lime . 
 Food was average and creme brulee was awful - the sugar was charred , not caramelized and smelled of kerosene . 
 To my right , the hostess stood over a busboy and hissed rapido , rapido as he tried to clear and re-set a table for six . 
 Terrible experience . 
 I was there on sat . 
 for my birthday and we had an excellent time . 
 I had the best ravioli ever . 
 The wine the service was very good too . 
 Moderate prices . 
 A little noise but I think that was because of our party ! 
 Went here on a friend 's reccomendation . 
 Enjoyed a very nice Caesar Salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese ....both very tasty . 
 We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh . 
 We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake , both were delicious . 
 We 'd go back again 
 I have been to Rao 's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better . 
 For those that go once and do n't enjoy it , all I can say is that they just do n't get it . 
 Rao 's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC . 
 Good luck getting a table . 
 I was at Rao 's last Wed. 
 for Meetball Night . 
 The service was excellent , the food was excellent , but the entire experience was very cool . 
 It 's true , you feel like your in a scene from Goodfellas . 
 Nicky the Nose at the bar is a treat . 
 If you wrote a bad review , it 's because you do n't understand what Rao 's is all about . 
 I ca n't wait for the nex time . 
 Been there , done that , and New York , it 's not that big a deal . 
 The food is decent at best , and the ambience , well , it 's a matter of opinion , some may consider it to be a sweet thing , I thought it was just annoying . 
 If celebrities make you sweat , then your in for a ride , but if your like most around these parts then you 'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype . 
 Rao is a good restaurant , but it 's nothing special . 
 Seriously , this place kicks ass . 
 Best Italian food I ever had ( and being Italian , that means alot ) . 
 It is nearly impossible to get a table , so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner , DO NOT pass it up . 
 The best burger I have had in the Village . 
 The service was attentive and her suggestions of menu items was right on the mark . 
 I liked the beer selection ! 
 Wow over 100 beers to choose from . 
 I will be returning . 
 My friends and I came across this place while walking in the village . 
 When we walked in it seemed like it was there for 200 years . 
 Really cool stauff inside . 
 We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for . 
 Simple comfort food and what hot and lage portions . 
 great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer . 
 If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde . 
 It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects . 
 The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions . 
 I highly recommend it . 
 I am going to the mid town location next . 
 If you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained , this is a great place to go and eat . 
 My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary , and to our surprise it was fantastic . 
 The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was del icious , if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini . 
 The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner . 
 Please take my advice , go and try this place . 
 Its located in greenewich village . 
 You will not be disapointed at all . 
 We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night . 
 We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks . 
 After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner . 
 The server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile . 
 The place 's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh . 
 I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks ! 
 This restaurant was recommended by a local ...as a matter of fact , he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed ! 
 We weren' t ! 
 The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food . 
 We liked it so much , that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York . 
 Park your trench coat at the coat check and be prepared for fine dining , expert  attentive table service and a delectable cuisine . 
 Warm , comfortable surroundings , nice appointments ( witness the etched glass and brickwork separating the dining rooms ) . 
 Great food at REASONABLE prices , makes for an evening that ca n't be beat ! 
 Want to impress ? 
 Definitely go here ! ! ! NOTE : Plan ahead , make a reservation and arrive early - parking is tight in the area - valet service is available if all else fails ! 
 Enjoy ! ! ! 
 To speak of the Park Side , words can not describe . 
 The well mannered , pleasant staff that Tony has in his employ . 
 You are treated just like royality . 
 There is nothing more pleasant than that . 
 The food is spectacular , from the appitizers to the main course , and then of course the desserts , ( WOW ) you 'll need no more . 
 I just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money . 
 Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens , this is among the best . 
 The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful . 
 It is expensive but well worth the money . 
 If you venture off the island of Manhattan and ca n't seem to find a great Italian restaurant , drive to Corona . 
 This is the BEST Shabu-Shabu Restaurant in the Try-State Area . 
 I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan . 
 Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu-Shabu . 
 Always popular , always full , always a wait . 
 I love the place . 
 Just wish they 'd expand . 
 I have eaten at Shabu Tatsu at least 5 times and I always want to go back for more ! 
 There is usually a wait but it is well worth it . 
 I always get the Shabu-Shabu dinner and the beef is always fresh . 
 The fried rice is really good too . 
 The staff is also attentive and friendly . 
 I would recommend putting your name down and then getting a drink at a local bar first though because of the wait time . 
 Great service , great food . 
 Prices are in line . 
 Compared to other shabu restaurants around town , this places wins hands-down . 
 But too far east ! 
 Shabu Tatsu serves 'shabu-shabu, ' the style of Japanese tableside cooking named for the gentle sound of boiling broth . 
 Each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface , and you get platters of thin sliced meats , various vegetables , and rice and glass noodles . 
 Dip the ingredients in with your chopsticks , swirl them around , and eat . 
 At the end you 're left with a mild broth with noodles that you can slurp out of a cup . 
 It can be a very fun experience with a group , and kids ( 6 and over ) would love it . 
 Do n't go alone---even two people is n't enough for the whole experience , with pickles and a selection of meats and seafoods . 
 The flavors are very fresh and pretty inobtrusive , nothing flashy . 
 Satisfying . 
 The other night we had the $ 30 three course meal and everything was delicious - if I could of licked the plate clean I would of . 
 I plan on eating here more often . 
 It 's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street . 
 As far as scary Smith Street , I am all for people being scared and turned off by the neighborhood . 
 One less manhattanite the better . 
 Oh , and the other poster who compared Saul to the Peruvian place across the street ... c'mon - you 're kidding , right ? 
 Not sure where the previous reviewer , lonk , dined , but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food ! 
 I 've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences . 
 I 'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service . 
 I think this would be a pretty good spot if it were not so overpriced and overrated . 
 Saul is pretty good , but definitely not great . 
 For those prices and the dressed up atmosphere you expect more and should get more . 
 The food was pretty good , but a little flavorless and the portions very small , including dessert . 
 Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street . 
 I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible . 
 Ca n't wait wait for my next visit . 
 I have eaten at Saul , many times , the food is always consistently , outrageously good . 
 Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn . 
 The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world . 
 The wine list is interesting and has many good values . 
 For the price , you cannot eat this well in Manhattan . 
 Planet Thai is great ! 
 We love the food , drinks , and atmosphere ! 
 The svc can be a bit rude at times , esp if you have big group , but overall the restaurant is a must ! 
 Try the Pad Thai , it 's fabulous and their prices are so cheap ! 
 Just because it 's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty , IT IS GREAT ! 
 Just remember , the later you go , the longer you may have to wait . 
 It 's popular w late crowd . 
 This place has the best interior I have seen anywhere in the northside of W' burg , and will impress whoever you bring there . 
 What is even better , is that the prices are very affordable as well , and the food is really good . 
 It 's not mind-blowing , but to me , thai food never is and never will be . 
 ( and I have eaten my share ) Which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve . 
 The service is always bad though , do n't expect much of anything from your server , and I would not recommend bringing a date here either . 
 Besides , when you have bad service , that 's less money you have to tip . 
 Very affordable and excellent ambient ! 
 We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai . 
 We were very disappointed . 
 We wo n't go to this place again for a good meal . 
 However , I think this place is a good hang out spot . 
 Next time , we would n't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks . 
 I absolutely love this place ! ! ! 
 From the street it looks very hidden , and is actually an old warehouse . 
 I like the ambience , it 's very dark and original . 
 I came here for my friend 's birthday and keep coming back ever since . 
 The sushi is amazing ! ! ! And amazingly cheap . 
 Big thumbs up ! 
 Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the thai food is excellent too . 
 With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored . 
 The atmosphere is n't the greatest , but I suppose that 's how they keep the prices down . 
 It 's all about the food ! ! 
 Try the mediterranean salad , it is a true experience for your taste buds ! ! 
 The burger was great , also . 
 In such a crappy part of town to find a good value for lunch , this place is great . 
 The tables are close together and lunch will cost you 40 bucks , but you have to remember that you are on 57th street in NYC ! ! ! What do you expect ? ! ? ! 
 This place is a great stop for great food . 
 This restaurant is not worth the time , effort , or money to say the least . 
 From the terrible service , to the bland food , not to mention the unaccommodating managers , the overall experience was horrible . 
 The food came out wrong , the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal . 
 The manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group . 
 The tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent . 
 The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful . 
 Inside is a little cramped , but to be expected . 
 Service was prompt and courteous . 
 This was a repeat visit and we 'll definitely be back again . 
 I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently . 
 She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy . 
 Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth . 
 In the evening , this place attracted a well dressed , with it , NY crowd . 
 The food was well prepared and the service impecable . 
 I 'm going back . 
 I have been there many times , and food is good and consistent . 
 After my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer . 
 It 's really also the service , is good and the waiters are friendly . 
 For sure i will keep coming back because i feel really this restaurant deserves . 
 Ruby Foo 's is a tourist trap . 
 You will pay a lot for the decore , but the food is no better or worse than a lot of other Chinese and Asian fusion places in NY. 
 For great chinese food nearby , you have Wu Liang Ye and Grand Sichuan just a block away . 
 For asian fusion , there are many places further downtown . 
 For an untrendy rip-off - eat here . 
 I went to Ruby Foo 's after work with a group of 6 . 
 We were seated promptly as we had reservations , however after that the service was slow . 
 I ordered a Chicken Teriyaki dish and found that the chicken was extremely dry . 
 Sushi was n't anything spectacular for the price . 
 The dim sum however was very good . 
 If you live in new york city , you 'll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount . 
 If your visiting , you 'll enjoy the ambiance and the fact that it 's in Time Sq ... 
 Three of us arrived for dinner about 5:30 on a week night without reservations . 
 We were told that the wait was about twenty minutes and there would be no problem for our 8:00 pm curtain call . 
 For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated . 
 In reality ( to maximize potential diners ) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby . 
 All we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner . 
 I went to Ruby Foos for my birthday and enjoyed our experience there . 
 The only disappointment was the coat check girls who did n't seem to know what a customer is on a realtively non-busy night ( for the coat check girls ) . 
 The food was great . 
 From the appetizers we ate , the dim sum and other variety of foods , it was impossible to criticize the food . 
 A++ The service was good to excellent along with the attitude . 
 Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square . 
 Overall , worht every penny . 
 I love this place more and more everytime i go . 
 I 've always been seated propm tly . 
 If you are in a big group , this place is perfect because it recomends sharing - they have lazy susans on most tables - even families can feel comfortable here . 
 Here you get the zen feel without feeling rigid . 
 The only reason you wouldnt like Ruby Foo 's is if you absolutely cant stand Asian Cuisine ... If thats not the case , get there quickly so you too and fall in LOVE with RUBY FOO'S ! ! ! ! 
 The website and rating makes this place look wonderful but in reality it was very disappointing . 
 The menu is nothing like the one on the website . 
 The food was so-so . 
 The waiters were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished . 
 Has the chef and owner changed ?? ? 
 After reading the reviews for Scopa online and reading the menu on their web site ...Scopa looked as though it would be a great place for dinner on a Saturday night . 
 I was wrong . 
 The food was just OK , at least for what food was available . 
 For some reason , all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the Salmon . 
 Something about them being busy with holiday party 's . 
 The food was just OK , I would never go back . 
 My fiance took me to Scopa last week for my birthday and I could n't believe the food . 
 Every course was better than the next . 
 One of my favorites though was the Angry Lobster , a cold lobster salad that was magnificent . 
 I will recommend Scopa to all of my friends for a place to go for wonderful Italian food . 
 came here for restaurant week , did n't save much , but it was still great . 
 it 's a huge place-best for renting out for big parties . 
 i would go again if i did n't have to pay . 
 would have rather tried terrace in the sky or water club for that price 
 My family and I ate here last night for our annual Christmas dinner with the family members who would rather spend the holidays with friends out-of-town . 
 The place was real empty but that was because this was the first Sunday they ever opened . 
 The food was delicious and the waiter was incredibly helpful and attentive ( considering we were the only ones there for the first hour ) . 
 All the appetizers and salads were fabulous , the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious ! ! ! 
 The food was absolutely amazing ! ! 
 The baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we 've ever had ! ! The lamb was tender so full of flavor , the dessert was divine ! ! 
 The waiter was attentive . 
 The place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening . 
 The open-air area is not good for conversation b it still is GCS. 
 But the food is good ; try the lobster with saffron sauce , very good . 
 But the food is good ; try the lobster with saffron sauce , very good . 
 Also good for client lunch meetings , esp. 
 for out-of-towners who will get a big thrill out of the locatio n ! 
 Pricey , but worth a try , at least once . 
 I really did n't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of Grand Central . 
 It was a very nice surprise . 
 Even though I made the reservation at 3pm for the same night through Dinnerbroker , we were seated at a table with one of the best view ! 
 My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our leisurely dinner with the interesting locale and excellent service ; our waiter was great ! 
 I must say it 's a little pricey for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view . 
 We were exploring Grand Central and did n't want to eat in the food court . 
 Metrazur has a beautiful spot overlooking the main terminal . 
 A bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks . 
 The food was very expensive ( we spent $ 160 for lunch for two ) but extremely tasty . 
 Besides , we were on vacation ! 
 Why do people rave about the ambience . 
 The aesthetics of this place are like an airport lounge . 
 Given the incredible architecture surrounding it , this place has no character . 
 Food was OK - fish was cooked well . 
 But , nothing stands out about the cooking . 
 Service was decent , but not as smooth as I would expect from a place with these prices and reputation . 
 No gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation . 
 The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing ! 
 The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs . 
 Looking around , I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen . 
 Beautiful experience . 
 I went with my fiance on a Tuesday evening . 
 At 6:30 , we were the third party there . 
 ordered the tasting menu. 
 2.5 hours and 9 dishes later ( three desserts ! ) we were stuffed and happy . 
 Got a little loud after 8pm when the joint got full . 
 But I 'd go back 
 An oasis of refinement : Food , though somewhat uneven , often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef 's passion ( and kitchen 's precise execution ) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups . 
 I have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme - and this chef accomplishes without fats . 
 Service is highly refined : our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress . 
 Meanwhile , the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil , gratis . 
 Bravo , Blue Hill ! 
 I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend . 
 The decor is very simple but comfortable . 
 The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach . 
 The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that . 
 You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert . 
 The staff there is very attentive and down to earth . 
 I loved it and would go again . 
 We have been to Montparnasse many times and return often for good reason . 
 The ambience is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service . 
 In addition , the food is very good and the prices are reasonable . 
 If you go for the pre-theatre menu , it 's an even greater deal . 
 I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river Seine . 
 Based on the reviews on here , it appears that the restaurant is overwhelmed after the 7 PM . 
 I went at 6:00 PM specifically for the pre-theater menu ( $ 19.95 for roasted tomato soup with chevre , steak frites , creme brulee ) and it was marvelous . 
 When we arrived at 6:00 PM , the restaurant was practically empty . 
 When we left at 8:00 PM , it was packed and noisy . 
 So some of the reviews here are accurate about the crowd and noise . 
 So if you want a nice , enjoyable meal at Montparnasse , go early for the pre-theater prix-fixe . 
 Bon appettite ! ! 
 After hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant , and passing by it on a daily basis , we decided to try . 
 We were less than impressed . 
 We ordered the chicken casserole , but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken , all dark meat and on the bone . 
 Probably would not go again ... 
 While this is a pretty place in that overly cute French way , the food was insultingly horrible . 
 We ordered the steak , with 'medium' for our beef . 
 What came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy . 
 No one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates . 
 Stay far away from this place . 
 I went for restaurant week and ordered off the prix fixe menu. 
 The food itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the service was awful . 
 Our server checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal . 
 It took nearly 2 hours to get in due to the service . 
 Even with the prix fixe pricing , this restaurant is not worth it . 
 Oh right , I should probably say something nice . 
 Ummm ...the beer was cold . 
 My wife and I went to Orsay for Valentine 's dinner . 
 But the thing that my wife and I hated was it was so loud and it felt like 'bar ' or 'pub' . 
 Food and service was okay . 
 Interior was so so . 
 The photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look . 
 At first i was rolling my ideas of yet another French place on the UES . 
 When I arrived at Orsay I was thrown back , in a veyr good sense . 
 I in all reality felt as if I had just gotten off Air France and was in the 8th District in Paris . 
 Orsay , is a very pleasnt throw back to traditional French food , and French service as well . 
 Since my first dinner I have had the chance to have brunch at Orsay 3x . 
 Never once did I leave feeling unwelcome or impressed . 
 Orsay , is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic French food in NYC . 
 We visited Orsay during NY Restaurant Week and tried their $ 35 menu. 
 Service was very good - prompt , attentive and non-intrusive . 
 Food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience ) . 
 Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top . 
 Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation . 
 I work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time . 
 The buffet had a nice selection . 
 The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes . 
 Service was also very good . 
 I would go back . 
 i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family . 
 The food was good . 
 The place was nice and calm . 
 but the service was a bit slow . 
 This was a great surprise . 
 With the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room . 
 The service was attentive . 
 I look forward to eating here again 
 Ok , so the servers wander around a little clueless , but there 's more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it 's fine , you just have to make a small effort to get their attention . 
 I care more about the food and ambience . 
 Everything is excellent , the menu is quite extensive , and you eat with a view on both sides of the city . 
 Try the Times Square cocktail -- ginger lemonade with vodka ( also available without vodka . ) 
 It took them 15 minutes to put water in our glasses . 
 It took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer . 
 It took them ALMOST AN HOUR to bring out the ent rees . 
 The lamb meat was under-cooked and EXTRMELY CHEWY . 
 They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice -RESUL T - WE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OF BURNT RICE IN OUR SERVING BOWL. 
 They never came back to refill our glasses again . 
 The food was authentic . 
 I felt as though I were eating in Paris . 
 The service was excellent - friendly and attentive . 
 The prices are wonderfully low . 
 Very good wine choices . 
 I went here in the afternoon with a friend . 
 The cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables , but the service could have been better . 
 We only ordered desserts and drinks , but no refills were offered . 
 Any how , we were able to sit as long as we wanted and chat , which was nice . 
 I 'm told that it is open 24hrs which is good . 
 We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date . 
 We were then shooed inside . 
 One would think we 'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so . 
 We left , never to return . 
 With so many good restaurants on the UWS , I do n't need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant wait-staff who do n't recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n't care . 
 After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner . 
 After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner . 
 The food was exceptional . 
 The menu consisted of standard brassiere food , better then places like Balthazar etc . 
 I choose to go with one of the special , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent . 
 The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual . 
 The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal 
 I was turned on to this restaurant by a fellow foodie friend of mine , and have been going back regularly ever since . 
 Everyone that has ever come here with me has become a convert and returned regularly with their own friends . 
 The pho is incredible , and I am a particular fan of the summer rolls , water spinach with garlic vegetables , and squid with chili lemongrass . 
 The wait staff is very friendly , if not overly efficient . 
 Once you become a regular , you are treated as one . 
 The prices cannot be beat for the quality , quantity , freshness and taste . 
 No food snobs allowed , this place is for people who appreciate good food . 
 Top spot in town for Vietnamese classics , better than places that cost a lot more . 
 Light , refreshing summer rolls ( not fried ) remind me of Vietnamese places in Paris . 
 Grilled whole fish wonderful , great sp icing . 
 Interesting other dishes for a change include chicken in curry sauce and salmon caserole . 
 Have always found that the waiters will go out of their way to be help ful , despite the fact they are often busy with lots of diners . 
 Ambiance and music funky , which I enjoy . 
 I 've been to this restaurant more than a dozen times and when I 'm craving for Pho , Lemon grass chicken or Beef Cube on rice , this is the place to go . 
 The average price for each dish during lunch is between $ 4.50 and $ 5 ! How can you beat that ? 
 There are other Vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those . 
 The food has been consistant for years and it never lets you down . 
 The service is descent even when this small place is packed . 
 Check it out , it wo n't hurt your stomach or your wallet . 
 the real kicker of the menu , however , is the beef cubes or the chicken with chili and lemon grass . 
 both are very reasonably priced ( around $ 8 for dinner and $ 5 for lunch ) , and are delicious and filling . 
 i've been back to nha trang literally a hundred times for the beef cubes - they 're that good . 
 also make sure you pay attention to the music being piped in - quite a weird selection . 
 i've noticed megadeth , mr . scruff , st. germain , traditional vietnamese songs , black sabbath , jay-z , and daft punk all being played . 
 Gigino 's in Wagner Park is so enjoyable . 
 The food is delicious . 
 The service is fine and they allow you to enjoy the view . 
 Its not the same if you have to sit inside . 
 For the location , the prices are very reasonable . 
 This is the kind of place you 'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret . 
 The setting is casual and romantic . 
 The setting is casual and romantic . 
 The food is excellent ! 
 if you 're daring , try the balsamic vinegar over icecream , it 's wonderful ! 
 This is such a lovely , peaceful place to eat outside . 
 The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty . 
 It is set far from the small street it 's on , and there is no traffic noise . 
 The food is good , especially their more basic dishes , and the drinks are delicious . 
 This is a great place to take out-of-towners , and perfect for watching the sunset . 
 The view is spectacular , and the food is great . 
 Wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well ! 
 Definitely worth the trip to Battery Park City ! 
 One of my favorite places in Manhattan . 
 I 've been to several places for Dim Sum and this has got to be the WORST . 
 They do n't walk around with the trays of Dim Sum . 
 You order from a menu , so you leave feeling like you missed the full experience . 
 The service was bad , the food took to forever to come , we sat on the upper level . 
 And the bill was outragous . 
 We actually left hungry and went across the street to Wo Hop at 15 Mott street for some good chinese food . 
 Chinese Desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness . 
 By far this is the only chinese desserts place I know in NY or anywhere close in the Northeastern America that serves desserts with frog jelly in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar . 
 By far this is the only chinese desserts place I know in NY or anywhere close in the Northeastern America that serves desserts with frog jelly in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar . 
 A cool place to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and desserts . 
 Another couple of specials is their bamboo rice , claypot congee noodles . 
 sometimes i get good food and ok service . 
 sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good good and bad service . 
 it is not consistent . 
 really depends on your luck ! 
 I usually go there later at night when I get off work so I do n't have to deal with crowds or lines . 
 The waitress remembers me and is very friendly , she knows what my regular is and that 's the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on beancurd . 
 They 've the best desserts and mixed drinks as well as snack foods . 
 If you 're looking for a place to sit down , have a drink and conversations with friends , go to sweet-n-tart and order yourself a hong-kong styled milk and tea with tapioca pearls ( hot ) . 
 A friend and I met at Mizu last night for dinner ; after a short wait of 15 minutes , we were given a nice little table by the window . 
 We shared a bottle of sake , an order of edamames , and she had the sushi plate while I had the sashimi . 
 What generous portions ! 
 I found the variety of the sashimi plate to be satisfying - fresh and yummy . 
 As far as the service goes , the waitresses were not particularly friendly , but they got the job done . 
 Whenever you need a Sushi fix , Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service . 
 Delivery is fast too . 
 Great friendly service , Fast seating , Fast Delivery , Excellent sushi . 
 A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite . 
 The editorial review led me to believe this would be a fun dinner spot , but that was n't exactly true . 
 While the food was excellent , it was n't cheap ( though not extremely expensive eithe r ) . 
 The service was mediocre , and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable meal . 
 The decor is really blah , and not at all hip or happening . 
 So , for good food i 'd recommend it , but not for a fun night out . 
 The people in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud . 
 I 'm not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and I all enjoy Mizu very much ... and we 're repeat customers . 
 Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there . 
 Make sure you have the Spicy Scallop roll. . . 
 it 's delicious ! 
 Mizu is the Japenese find in Grammercy . 
 While their kitchen food is del icious , their Sushi is out of this world . 
 Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else . 
 Not only is the cuisine the best around , the service has always been attentive and charming . 
 Warn ing : You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu ! 
 Good bagels and good cream cheese . 
 None of that yucky whipped stuff . 
 But they do n't have a toaster , which is strange . 
 Great bagels made the old-fashioned way . 
 The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price (if bought by the poun d ) . 
 Dra wbacks : service is slow and they do n't toast ! 
 Never fails to please . 
 delicious bagels , especially when right out of the oven . 
 Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey . 
 Service is fast and friendly . 
 Only drawback - they wo n't toast your bagel , and they do n't make eggs for the bagel . 
 But that is highly forgivable . 
 Very neighborhoody , very quick and sufficient . 
 Nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable price . 
 Other apetizers and food 
 Compared to Ess-a , Tal offers a less doughy bagel ! 
 They even scoop it out nice ( for those on a diet ) not too much not to little . 
 The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee ! ! 
 A little crowded but they move that line really fast ! 
 A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning ! 
 The # 1 - Masala Dosa was quite good , I would scale it a 6 . 
 but I was not a fan of the 'fusion dosa ' where the filling went from portabella mushroom to avocado . 
 I grew up eating Dosa and have yet to find a place in NY to satisfy my taste buds . 
 For a cute place to go , check out this place ...and definatly at leasty try # 1 with cilantro chutney . 
 A cheap eat for NYC , but not for dosa . 
 The fillings may be unconventional but the dosa batter is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty . 
 I tried the curry chicken , masala and portobello cheese dosas - all of which were delicious . 
 The highly spiced chai tea was great too . 
 Only complaint would be that at an average cost of $ 12-$ 15 per meal , I 'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat ! 
 So , the menu is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious . 
 Sandwiches are straightforward and lovely - drinks in the cooler range from diet soda to a perfect mango lassi. 
 Then you order a dosa ( get # 12 ! ) and they serve you the Biggest Piece of Food in the World - an unthinkable 2 feet long . 
 Trust me , it will be great , and all of it will be devoured in no time . 
 You can even get packages of the chutneys to stock your fridge ! 
 Anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet , where greasy , dry and tasteless are complimentary . 
 The dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally I 'd drink popcorn topping before I 'd eat another one of these . 
 The sandwiches are dry , tasteless and way overpriced . 
 Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance , but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too . 
 On a monthly basis my friends and I get together and have a girls night out . 
 We try frequenting new restaurants all over the city , but any time that we visit a restaurant other than Roth 's we are always disappointed . 
 The food is amazing ! ! ! ! 
 The quality of food at this restaurant accompanied by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10 ! 
 This is definitely an excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the night scene is more than alive . 
 I recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys fine cuisine at reasonable prices . 
 I have been to Roth 's twice and both times were very disappointing . 
 Once for dinner and once for brunch . 
 Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service , which was boarderline rude . 
 They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another . 
 Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you . 
 The dinner was ok , nothing I would have again . 
 I had their eggs benedict for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was . 
 I have been coming to this neighborhood spot for years . 
 The filet mignon is the best I have had in the city and I have been to all the major steakhouses ... Lugers , Sparks , etc . 
 The only other steakhouse that seems to hold a candle to Roth 's is the Strip House . 
 The garlic mashed potatoes are hands down the best in the city ! 
 And Kruno , the beverage manager is the best bartender I have yet to come acr oss . 
 His drinks are very inventive , delicious and classy . 
 Great find ! ! ! 
 I have been in many restaurants all over the city and Roth 's Steakhouse has quickly become one of my favorites . 
 From the moment you enter till the moment you walk out the friendly and helpful staff was was just Fantastic . 
 Please try the Filet Mignon , its just the most tender piece ever . 
 The zucchini and mashed potatoes are a blend of garlic and butter which simply melts in your mouth . 
 To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert , especially the White Chocolate Bread Pudding with Gelato and hot chocolate . 
 If you go to Roth 's try to be served by Mike , he is GREAT ! ! 
 This was n't the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup , but I thought that was what made the place so special . 
 I ordered tamarind duck and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef , and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked Thai flavors in unexpected ways . 
 Instead of being pan-Asian , I thought it was simply a creative take on Thai cuisine ... and I 'd much rather have innovation with traditional Thai spices than another unremarkable noodle dish . 
 Plus , when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night , the owner sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over ! 
 Our waitress was sweet and accomodating , not overbearing . 
 The music does get a little loud at times , but it just made me want to lean closer to my beautiful wife , and as I did , I got a whiff of corriander . 
 but I would n't wanna live there . 
 I liked the food at this quasi-thai restaurant . 
 It was nice and fresh , but I ca n't give it high scores on being authentic thai . 
 The food was very good , but not very thai . 
 If you 'd like to have a nice light meal with an asian accent , Long Tan is a good place on the slope . 
 wow ! how have i missed this one ,tried Long Tan last week for the first time and now know what the NY TIMES and many more in the neighborhood already knew . 
 yourself a favor and have dinner here and see if you dont agree with me . 
 I had my eyes on this place , promising myself I will one day 'give it a try . ' And I hate to say this but I doubt I 'll ever go back . 
 The food is very average ...the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet , every thing they serve is too sweet here . 
 The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree . 
 I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty ( could 've used a bit more salt ) . 
 Anyways , if you 're in the neighborhood to eat good food , I would n't waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to Tamari . 
 The decor is night tho ...but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling ...its quite un-appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern . 
 I 've never felt more unwelcome than last month at Jimmy 's Bronx Cafe . 
 I try my best to give an accurate description of any establishment visited . 
 This time , I prefer not to go into detail . 
 I seriously doubt I will ever dine at Jimmy 's Bronx , or for that matter , Jimmy 's Uptown , again . 
 Not only would I not recommend Jimmy 's restaurants to friends , I would strongly suggest they go anywhere but . 
 I thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience . 
 Jimmy is Dominican ! 
 Well , this place is so Ghetto its not even funny . 
 If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you 'll love it here . 
 Would NEVER go back there . 
 Too bad Latin Quarters closed . 
 That place was awesome , , , sally ! 
 Jimmy 's is hands down the hottest night spot in the Bron x. 
 Right off the major deegan you get ladies from all over the city . 
 Good food at the restaurant ( a bit expensive , but great if you want to impress your date ) . 
 After dinner , take your date to the HUGE dance floor , probably one of the biggest you 'll see in NY. 
 Some of the finest latin women you 'll see in your life hang out at Jimmy 's . 
 Great bar , most gorgeous bartenders you 've ever seen ( specifically the blond lady ) . 
 Good atmosphere , combination of all the hottest music dress code is relatively strict except on Fridays . 
 The service is fantastic . 
 The food there is so good that even to order out the wait is incredible . 
 But trust me it is so worth it . 
 I am completely hooked on this place , it is ridiculous . 
 As soon as I wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how I will be getting to fried dumpling . 
 I keep my fingers crossed the whole subway ride hoping that there will be a table I can sit at by myself and not have to share with the rice congee soup people . 
 I drop more dollar bills here than your uncle after a weekend at Scores . 
 I go back in line like three times on average until I ca n't walk anymore. 
 Never in my life did I think that I could be satisfied both in taste and in quantity for $ 3.00 in NYC . 
 Fried dumpling is the arguably the quickest value in NYC . 
 At 5 dumplings for $ 1 , you just cannot go wrong . 
 Although the place could be a little more eye catching and roomier , at the same time , it does n't really matter . 
 Get your food to go , find a bench , and kick back with a plate of dumplings . 
 I almost wanted to write a bad review , so no one would ever go here and I could have all the dumplings to myself ! 
 SO SO SO SO SO good ! 
 And cheap ! 
 I wish they had one near my office - I would go everyday . 
 Go , go , hurry , before everyone finds out about it . 
 The place was n't too hard to find , but it was kind of packed , as soon as my boyfriend and I got our food , the line reached the door . 
 The food is very good for it 's price , better than most fried dumplings I 've had . 
 The soup is pretty good too . 
 It 's a really great deal , considering we got full off of four dollars . 
 It 's a great place to pick up a cheap lunch or dinner . 
 It only took about five or so minutes to get an empty table , but standing up was n't too bad . 
 Alone for 100 bucks , it is really overprice . 
 The food is great , service is ok . 
 It is not worth for that bucks . 
 You have to increase the service a lot . 
 Knowledge of the chef and the waitress are below average . 
 They sell special sushi , everything have a topping , sauce and etc . 
 That 's why you have to pay more for that . 
 I 've been here a couple of times and have not been impressed . 
 The sushi is average and the prices are anything but . 
 The service is awful--the last time I was there ( and I do mean the last time ) we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave . 
 Had we been stalling I could understand where they were coming from , but we had been there less than an hour and they had n't even brought us a check yet ! 
 The fish is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary . 
 The sauces used are also not that exciting . 
 If the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items BBQ-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance . 
 The NYC has available to it so many different vegetables , meats , and fishes ; and Japanese cuisine has a number of unique foods and preparations all of which could have been used here with greater effect but all we get almost nothing of the sort . 
 I came to this restaurant expecting to be surprised but left bored and overcharged . 
 Perhaps this food is considered extreme to an Upper East Side resident , but for the rest of us who 've actually eaten ethnic food , this is simply dull . 
 This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down . 
 The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic . 
 Get the tuna of gari . 
 The one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side . 
 Outstanding Bagels , but you get what you pay for . 
 This is n't a value joint . 
 While they keep the capex to a minimum , they do put some cash into the bagels , because they among the best in the city . 
 It 's really a takeaway place , I would n't sit if I could take it home . 
 If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave . 
 Great bagels , spreads and a good place to hang out in . 
 Great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work . 
 Unlike HH up the block , this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for . 
 Of course this atmosphere is lacking , but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways ? 
 Pick a bagel on 2nd has the best chicken salad ever ... even there low fat is good . 
 The employees are excellent .. some even know me by name and order ( pathetic for me ) ...i just ca n't stay away ! 
 plus the make your own salad . .... they do not have limits on what or how much you can put on it . 
 you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce ! 
 Bagels are ok , but be sure not to make any special requests ! 
 I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewher e ! 
 Be sure not to get anything other than bagels ! ..the turkey burgers are scary ! 
 Pick a bagel has the best bagels in the city . 
 big and soft as well as good lunch food . 
 They outshine HH. 
 Sometimes this is the BEST food and others ...well , it just sucks . 
 The problem is just that-it is a sometimes kind of affair . 
 But , hey , there is anything better with a decent vegetarian selection in Astoria . 
 So , again , give it a try . 
 I recommend ordering in on a weeknight . 
 Apparently , the good cook works then . 
 Good Chicken w peanut sauce , but my friend 's mixed sqewer dish was n't that great : it 's chicken was a lil dry and the shrimp a lil too salty . 
 But the coconut rice was good . 
 Place should also have a 1,2,3 chili rating to be more authentic... 
 Were meeting up with some friends for a drink at Lafayette 161 and happened to walk by Thai Angel famished . 
 It was raining , and we figured why not ? 
 The interiors are warm , tables lit by candlelight , patrons happily eating and praising the wait staff and cook constantly .. .pretty rare to see ..and strange . 
 I ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the pad thai chicken . 
 The chu chu curry was really delish but the pad thai ..unbelievable ...and a large portion too ! 
 The Thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and yummy ! 
 Only boo was the rice ..i think it is called jasmine rice but not sure , had a dry texture to it .. seemed like left over rice . 
 But other than that ..not bad at all ! 
 One of the best Thai Restaurant .Good services .Good 
 Price .Food was Delicious and Testy . 
 You better try Lab-Ped ( Spicy Duck Salad . ),Pad Thai,Tom yum Kung ,etc . 
 Only had delivery so ca n't speak to ambience , but considering the lack of attention they give the food , there certainly ca n't be much to see there . 
 The mussaman curry that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it , they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato . 
 Instead of wasting your time here : SUPPORT RESTAURANTS THAT CARE ABOUT FOOD . 
 Plain and simple it 's bad thai food . 
 The red curry is weak and tasteless , the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy , the rice is often overcooked , and the seafood is pretty sketchy . 
 Do n't eat here unless you 're starving for thai food and you work next door . 
 I love the fact that the pizza tastes so good and is so cheap . 
 It 's only $ 1.95 for a regular slice and $ 4.00 for a slice with a mushroom , not mushrooms . 
 Nothing better than buying a snapple for $ 3.25 too . 
 A great way to make some money is to buy a case of snapple from Costco and sell it right outside for only $ 2.50 . 
 It 's a steal ! 
 The pizza is good though . 
 Awsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice . 
 Always busy but fast moving . 
 Great atmoshere and worth every bit . 
 Open late ( well as late as I ever got there and I 'm a night person ) 
 Love Pizza 33.. 
 I will be out with friends and all of a sudden I am hungry and I only crave one thing ... their Pizza . 
 I live in the neightborhood and am a regular . 
 It hits the spot every time 
 I live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of The Pizza Place at 3 am . 
 The owners and employees are friendly and their pizza is fantastic . 
 Everything a NY pizza joint should be . 
 GO HERE. 
 NOW . 
 This is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the Basil slice . 
 Their calzones are horrific , bad , vomit-inducing , YUCK. 
 They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone . 
 The counter service is bad . 
 They charge different prices all the time . 
 They 're rude at times , and not very friendly . 
 NO PIZZA 33 for me ! 
 I am Indian , and I have tried many Indian places in NY. 
 I went to Amma after a friend recommended it . 
 The food was absolutely horrible ! 
 There are much better places in NY with better prices . 
 In fact , while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu , and I could n't help telling them that the food was horrible . 
 my first time here was with my gf for our 12 month anniversary . 
 so i thought why not change it up a bit . 
 but still my date was bad 
 I 'll keep this short . 
 Amma is nothing special . 
 The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place . 
 I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive . 
 Will not be back . 
 Amma has the worst value for money I have experienced in NYC over the past 2 years . 
 The food is o.k. , but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant . 
 But for whatever reason , prices are about twice as high . 
 It cannot be the ambience , because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle . 
 The most annoying thing , though , is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue . 
 Nothing against a good sales call , but the tactics at Amma are just too obvious . 
 Its an excellent place to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of New York . 
 one of the best Chicken Tikka Masala . 
 The music is the best among all the Indian restaurants I have visited . 
 A must for all the Dosa lovers . 
 I took my girlfriend there for her birthday last night and we had a relaxing , really good meal . 
 They treated us well and the food was extremely fresh and well-prepared . 
 The menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them . 
 Also , the hostess called me today to thank us for coming and mentioned how she hoped that my girlfriend enjoyed her birthday - unexpected , but a truly above and beyond thing to do ... 
 We had reservations at 9pm , but was not seated until 10:15pm . 
 It was rather pathetic that it took them over an hour to seat us . 
 Why make a reservation if you are n't going to keep it ? 
 Quite poor service ... Our appetizers came pretty quickly , but it was another hour till the entrees showed up . 
 By the time we were done , it was past 1:00 am . 
 While we enjoyed the food , we were highly disappointed by the poor service ( waiter was not quite competent and SLOW service ) and lack of rem orse . 
 The only comp we got was some champagne ... which was n't fabulous . 
 Bottom line : B+ for the food , F for the service . 
 Went for a late weekday lunch . 
 Decor is minimalist and clean - nothing to distract or commend . 
 Service was very friendly . 
 Lunch prix fixe of $ 25 or $ 35 allows some mixing and matching ( with price supplement ) , but I was happy to go with the variety on the lower-priced menu. 
 Fluke sashimi drizzled with jalapeno-lime olive oil , the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish 's sweetness . 
 A touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed. 
 Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed , however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance . 
 Overall , the ingredients and technique are there and I am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves . 
 fresh restaurant was amazing .... .... food was delicious and of course fresh . 
 great for a romantic evening , or a fun evening with friends ... 
 I will be going back very soon . 
 keep up the good work . 
 Hats off to the chef . 
 The girl who waited on us ( and mind you we were a table of ah , downtown fashion people ) seemed to be more concerned with who was walking in the front door and gossiping w co-workers than paying attention to our order . 
 Drinks got screwed up , she acted put upon . 
 Guess the 555Soul ads did n't launch her big modeling career . 
 Total hipster-wannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet spot . 
 Really tasty spring rolls and noodles for a good price though . 
 Ok , so it 's kinda cool looking ... the musics 's pretty good ... and I 'll even go as far as saying the food LOOKS good . 
 Really though , where's the seasoning ? 
 This food is asian-air fusion . 
 Makes you crave MSG... no kidding ! 
 The drinks are a saving grace , but service staff , please , get over yourselves . 
 Do n't look down your nose at me like that ... 
 I 'm helping pay for your job , and remember , you work as service staff in a restaurant - you know ... people out for a NICE time , etc. . 
 I 'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food . 
 The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed . 
 Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great . 
 DO not try unless you 're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste . 
 I have been twice to this restaurant . 
 I love it . 
 I plan on stopping by next week as well . 
 I found it on a cold night , the perfect spot to warm up . 
 I recieved prompt service with a smile . 
 To me it exemplifies Soho , cute , artsy , interesting . 
 Definately check it out ! ! ! 
 Tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it 's one of my favorite dishes . 
 It was not above ordinary and the beef version had cheap ( undercooked ) beef . 
 I also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order . 
 Incredible food at a very agreable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic Thai restaurant . 
 Service is extraordinary , yet not overbearing , and the decor brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens . 
 The food 's dazzling flavors overwhelm the palate , truly embracing the beauty of authentic Thai cuisine . 
 Try the Pad Se-Ew or Chicken with Cashew Nuts for a memorable and repeatable experience . 
 This place , which is only a few months old , is perhaps Queens ' biggest secret ! 
 Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you 're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant , very very good food , cheaply-priced , generally friendly staff , and if you 're a Manhatta nite , or spend most of your time in Manhattan , Rice Avenue will make you feel at home .....very Soho West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele .....all on Roosevelt Avenu e ! 
 This Thai restaurant is a couple blocks away from Sripraphai ( another delicious Thai restaurant ) . 
 I really liked the noodle dishes at Rice Avenue compared to their Green Curry dish . 
 The atmosphere is much better than Sripraphai (more modern and sleek ) . 
 Another plus is most of the entrees are approx . 
 $ 6 ! ! ! All you have to do is hop on the 7 train for a couple of stops . 
 The food is consistently wonderful - I 've been coming here for years , and the owner has always been accomodating and friendly . 
 I love this place ! 
 A hearty two thumbs up ! 
 I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it . 
 Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city . 
 They have authentic Indian at amazin prices . 
 This restaurant is VEGETARIAN ; there are NO MEAT dishes whatsoever . 
 The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches . 
 It 's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early . 
 I 've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times , when I have been in the neighborhood . 
 It is terrific , as is the value . 
 $ 6 and there is much tasty food , all of it fresh and continually refilled . 
 I am not a vegetarian but , almost all the dishes were great . 
 Frankly , when you compare what you can have here for lunch , versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city , there is no comparison . 
 Go hungry and enjoy . 
 Disappointing food , lousy service . 
 Edible but really a ripoff at those prices given whats in the area . 
 I ordered a Lassi and asked 4 times for it but never got it . 
 I noted it was crossed off on the bill . 
 The Thali was small , thoroughly unremarkable , and $ 14.95 . 
 Note that they do not serve beer , you must bring your own . 
 I 'm from sichuan , this is the restaurant I recommend going . 
 food is del icious , the affordable price makes it more attractive ( most items ~$ 10 ) . 
 What makes this restaurant special are the authentic sichuan cooking and being the only one in NYC that offers authentic chongqing hotpot . 
 my picks are : - Scallion Pancake ( fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty ) - Guizhou Chicken - Shredded Squid Family Style ( one of my personal favorites ) - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab - Shuizhu Fish ( this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans , I would n't recommend to my American friends as it 's very spicy . 
 But people from Sichuan will die for it ) - Chongqing Hot Pot , chongqing was the biggest city of Sichuan , now became an independent province . 
 This is also where I was from . 
 : ) 
 I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read . 
 Sauce was watery and the food did n't have much flavor . 
 If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you . 
 I do n't think I would go again . 
 I consider the best Grand Sichuan restaurant in NYC . 
 It is run by the same Sichuan chef who started the chain in Chinatown . 
 If your favorite Chinese food is General Tao chicken , then this is NOT your place . 
 Quality of food is excellent and price is cheap , stick to pork , fish , chicken , lamb and vegetables . 
 my picks : Guizhou chicken , fish with hot bean source , fish fillet in spicy source ( special menu ) . 
 Be careful , when they say spicy , they mean it ! 
 If you want Americanized Chinese food with your usual watery , generic white sauce , this is your place . 
 They even have a section in the menu called American Chinese food ! 
 The hot and sour soup was unbearably hot and tasted of only pepper and nothing else . 
 My entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid , and was unnecessarily heated with a burner . 
 The sauce was watery and tasted heavily of MSG . ( I was thirsty as hell afterwards . ) My companion 's entree did n't fare any better either . 
 ( Both our entrees were not from the AC section . ) His cabbage with baby shrimp came also with the same watery sauce , and no real shrimp , but dried , reconstituted shrimpthe cheapest thing you can buy . 
 He was terribly thirsty after the meal too . 
 What a ripoff ! 
 Do n't go there ! 
 This branch is run by the same chef as the Chelsea Grand Sichuan branch ; dishes we have ordered so far at both Lexington and Chelsea branches have been prepared identically . 
 The only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting , the additional menu items are only written in Chinese . 
 This is my favorite Italian restaurant in all of New York City . 
 My wife and I will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them , as they tend to offer large portions . 
 Our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken ( usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats ) . 
 The eggplant parmesan is also great , and my friend who grew up in Manhattan claims that no one serves a better baked ziti with meatsauce . 
 The decor is nice , but more casual than fine dining . 
 This is as good as neighborhood restaurants come . 
 Appetizers are somewhere around $ 7 each and the main dishes are between $ 11 and $ 16 . 
 i dined here with my girlfriend and we sampled a few different types of pizza . the thin crust was only average but the others were fantastic . 
 though the service could be better ( possibly due to more than one very large group in the house ) , it is very cordial and warm , as is the general clientele . 
 strike up a conversation with the attorney next to you , or with the local union worker on the other side . 
 great eats , good times . 
 This is a fun restaurant to go to . 
 The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere . 
 But the pizza is way to expensive . 
 A large is $ 20 , and toppings are about $ 3 each . 
 This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn . 
 The pizza is overpriced and soggy . 
 Yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right . 
 A big disappointment , all around . 
 The portions are HUGE , so it might be good to order three things to split ( rather than one appetizer and entree per person ) for two people . 
 Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants , this offers by far one of the best values for your money . 
 Ca n't wait to go back . 
 Joe 's Pizza used to have the best slice until this pizzeria opened up . 
 The ingredients taste fresher , the crust is thinner and crispier , the slice is less oily , and it 's never burnt like it occasionally is at Joe 's . 
 The plain slice is great and if you get toppings , the whole slice is topped with them , not sparsely sprinkled on like some places . 
 They 're also friendlier here , especially the owner , Kenny . 
 Try it side by side and there 's no comparison . 
 Bleecker St Pizza is the best ! 
 I have tried the various slice joints around the village but this is by far the best one . 
 The sauce on the pizza is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they do n't skimp . 
 The sicilian is my favorite it is moist not dry like most places but all their pizza is great ! 
 Do yourself a favor and walk the extra avenue from joe 's to eat here . 
 Both the fresh mozzerella slices and the Plain Cheese slice are phenomenal . 
 The sauce is delicious and the crust is perfect . 
 Even with John 's and Joe 's around the corner , this place will make a name for itself . 
 The owner is very friendly and a great guy , go try his pizza , you 'll like it ! 
 The takeout menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes , I ca n't wait ! 
 Searching to get out from the cold , freezing weather , we went into what we thought was a deli . 
 Turned out there was full service upstairs and sat down . 
 We had the most wonderful waitress . 
 All the items she recommended were phenomenal , even the exotic sounding dishes lik the crabmeat avocado dumplings ( heaven ) and cilantro soup ( much better than it sounds ) . 
 For some reason the place was empty at peak lunch hour ...do n't understand why , the service was great , great priced , delicious food quiet . 
 Not someplace I would seek to try out but if I am in the area again , I will certainly stop by . 
 Ssearching for a restaurant in midtown that was kid friendly , wife came in w a 4yr old and 9 mth old and her parents , and came upon this . 
 What a mistake ...We arrived @ 1:45 and sat down @ 2:00 not too bad ...@ 2:00 they were out of fries , imagine a 4yr old not getting fries , we were served with a mixed green salad after we gave our vegetable order as a sub. 
 asked for italian dressing received ceaser w anchovies , asked for xtra napkins , forks and peper never got them . 
 moral stay away . 
 they did give a 15 % discount at the end , was n't enough , as they knew the service was horrible . 
 still stay away , the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were serves eventhough they were there much longer ... 
 Great deal ! 
 I saw a handwritten sign and went in to kill some time , $ 5 wines , $ 3 beers ?! ? Are you kidding me ? 
 The space was gorgeous , the bartender was ... sigh ! 
 And they have these home made potato chips at the bar that are the most delicious things in the world ! 
 We had to ask the bartender to stop refilling the bowl because we could n't help ourselves ...they were that good . 
 For some reason the place was empty when we got in and remained so for the entire evening , I do n't understand why but we had a blast and will definately go back the next time we are in the area . 
 this is the best secret place in midtown' , I heard that from the bartender , after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms ) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday . 
 The staff is excellent , specjal : that girl behind the bar , european chic . 
 I thought that she has been working there only cuz of her look to get some guys in the suit , but she is propably the friendliest female bartender in NYC . and that Asian girl . 
 Go girls ! ! ! 
 She got us the apple pie ! ! which is soo brilliant . 
 and hey the prices ?? ? ? nothing for the midtown and Rock Plaza . 
 we spent 50 $ $ definetly will come back with my friends ! ! ! 
 I 'm happy to have Nosh in the neighborhood and the food is very comforting . 
 But I 've got to second the comment that the owner has some issues handling customers and staff . 
 I 've overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the dining area and I 've been sitting there while he lectured another customer . 
 It could have been handled better . 
 Made my dining experience uncomfortable . 
 However , they 've got the most amazing pastrami and the soups hit the spot . 
 I did n't expect to like Nosh as much as I did , but the pastrami on challah sandwich I had was otherworldly , the soups are like Mom 's , and the knishes give Yonah Schimmel 's a run for its money . 
 They might be all business at the counter when you give your order , but their food says I love you . 
 Get the soup and a nosh ( pastrami sandwich ) for $ 8 and you 're golden . 
 We had a most unpleasant experience at this restaurant . 
 We ordered a tuna melt - it came with out cheese which just made it a tuna sandwich . 
 We also ordered two hot dogs thinking they would be pretty good since there is a whole section on the menu devoted to them . 
 They showed up 15 minutes after the tuna melt . 
 The hot dogs were cold in the middle and the buns were stale . 
 As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were . 
 This should have been done in a back room - away from customers . 
 This is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together . 
 ...and that 's saying a lot . 
 Maybe I say so because it looked promising for people who like artery-clogging jewish deli food , but turns out to be poorly run and awful . 
 It appears to be the owner 's first venture and it shows . 
 The food is terrible and overall , I would have to say avoid at all costs . 
 Lahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty food on the cheap -- you 'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for FOUR DOLLARS . 
 It 's constantly open , catering to the Pakistani cabbies lined up on Crosby St. , so there 's more turnover with the food than you 'd expect ( i.e. , surprisingly fresh ) . 
 Since it literally is a complete hole in the wall , it 's a bit intimidating at first , but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - do n't hesitate to ask for help with what to get . 
 I 'd definitely recommend this little place . 
 Looking from the outside in , one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall ( really , that 's what it is ) . 
 A narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters , a great deal of mess ( st acks of bottles , cans ) and a small counter holding 12-14 ent rees . 
 Behind this counter , two men are squeezed in . 
 The one up front will smile and say What can I get for you , brother ? 
 ( or sister , in my case ! ) . 
 While this can hardly be called a restaurant , it is possibly the best deal in Manhatten : $ 4 for a plate heaped with rice and 2-3 ent rees . 
 Food does n't appear to be cooked on premisis but there 's a high turnover so its pretty fresh . 
 And its absolutely DELICIOUS. 
 Ask any Pakistani taxi driver to vouch for it as they 're the main clientele - and that 's how you know you 've struck gold . 
 This place is a great bargain . 
 Authentic Pakistani food . 
 People are always friendly . 
 Do n't waste money on decor . 
 Just straight up cheap , good food . 
 The place is a lot of fun . 
 My six year old loved it . 
 The characters really make for an enjoyable experience . 
 The food however , is what one might expect . 
 It is very overpriced and not very tasty . 
 However , I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once . 
 We had a good time . 
 This place is so much fun . 
 Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant . 
 This place must have cost the owners afortune to build . 
 I think the stuff was better than Disney . 
 Our food was great too ! 
 And really large portions . 
 The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York . 
 We will go back every time we are in the City . 
 THE MOST FUN RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO ! 
 I LOVED THE SHOWS . 
 I LOVED THE SHOWS . 
 I REALLY ENJOYED THE SHOWS PUT ON BY THE ACTORS . 
 THE FOOD PORTIONS ARE REALLY LARGE. 
 THE BEST PLACE TO BRING KIDS OR ANY FRIENDS WHO WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT . 
 YOU MUST GO . THERE IS NOTHING ELSE LIKE IT ! 
 I had a grat time at Jekyll and Hyde ! 
 I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors . 
 Our server was very helpful and friendly . 
 I am bringing my whole family back next time . 
 I am bringing my whole family back next time . 
 We had a wonderful meal at Naples 45 a month ago on a visit to NYC . 
 Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city ( Seattle ) , we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant . 
 Quality ingredients preparation all around , and a very fair price for NYC . 
 Would definitely go back again . 
 The pizza here is delicious . 
 The combination of fresh tomato sauce , fresh mozz cheese , basil and the dough they make with imported flour , makes this is one of the better pizza 's in NY. 
 They have some great entrees here as well . 
 Service is great , takeout is good too . 
 Would recommend - perfect for those looking for a place close to grand central . 
 I 've been to Naples 45 for dinner twice . 
 I 've had pizza both times and the caprese salad appetizer . 
 Both are del icious , the cooks are friendly and are willing to take a moment and speak to you and shake your hand . 
 The service is a bit slow , but harkens back to my years growing up in Napoli , Italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night . 
 Great pizza for lunch place . 
 Service was quick . 
 The pizza was great . 
 And it was quick which is very important . 
 Have the iced tea . 
 It was wonderful . 
 Going to Volare is like going to your favorite aunt 's house for dinner , assuming that your aunt is a great Italian cook . 
 Everyone treats you like you were part of the family . 
 We did n't even see a menu , as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes . 
 Two people in our party felt like something else , and Volare immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular menu. 
 We had great desserts ( including the best cannoli I 've ever had ) and then they offered an after dinner drink , on the house . 
 They brought glasses and the bottle , and just left the bottle at our table . 
 A great experienc e ! 
 Go to Volare for 1st class service and terrific food . 
 The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter . 
 The wine list is excellent . 
 The only thing more wonderful than the food ( which is exceptio nal ) is the service . 
 The only thing the waiters do n't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave . 
 Wonderful at holiday time . 
 Volare virgins or weekly regulars , everyone gets treated the same and you ca n't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly . 
 The restaurant has a Family feel , not least with regard to the portions which are enormous ; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine . 
 The anti-pasta was excellent , especially the calamari , as were the filling pasta mains . 
 The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal . 
 Still , any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ... 
 I suspect this restaurant is what Rao 's would be if it had n't turned exclusive . 
 The food is uniformly exceptional , with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating , whether it 's on the menu or not . 
 I 'm constantly impressed by the waiters-- true professionals who seem to be having a great time . 
 The decor is a bit cheesy , and the owner does n't seem to mind when a regular feels like smoking an illicit cigarette ( grrr .. . ) but I guess that kinda adds to the charm . 
 The decor is a bit cheesy , and the owner does n't seem to mind when a regular feels like smoking an illicit cigarette ( grrr .. . ) but I guess that kinda adds to the charm . 
 The wine list is n't great , and the desserts are shipped in from Bruno 's down the street , which is not as good as it used to be . 
 And you 're hungry a few hours later . 
 Seriously , this is the best all you can eat in town - As everyone says , the Spicy Tuna hand rolls are the best - have 4 of these , and you 've broken even . 
 I 've rarely had a problem with slow staff in the 10 years I 've been going . 
 Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu , though- too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick . 
 The all you can eat deal is truly amazing here . 
 $ 20 gets you unlimited sushi of a very high quality - I even took a friend here from Japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the US that he has been to . 
 Highly recommended is the Spicy Fried Clam Rolls and Spider Rolls . 
 Everything is del icious , though , my gf and I come here once a week sometimes - you will get addicted ! 
 It is a small restuarant so go early and it will be nice and quiet - go late and it will be packed ! 
 This place has realy fresh sushi and a nice large menu of Japanese classic cuisine . 
 This big draw is the all you can sushi here for $ 19.95 ! 
 The catch is that you are charged extra for ANYTHING that you leave on your plate so do n't be a greedy pig ! 
 We come from New Jersey to eat at Kinoko . 
 Not the greatest sushi place , but excellent for a $ 19.95 all you can eat . 
 The spicy tuna and salmon are the best we 've ever had . 
 Service can be tediously slow and inattentive when busy . Parking stinks . 
 I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri . 
 Stuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing . 
 You can do it here . 
 $ 20 for all you can eat sushi cannot be beaten . 
 Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them . 
 Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded . 
 Drinks way over priced . 
 Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit 
 I 've read some of the previews reviews - people are either not New Yorkers or have more appreciation for ambience then food . 
 Should you happen to be impressed by the cuisine definitely try it . 
 It is not a place for tourists or someone who has never dined in Bay R idge . 
 Yes , there might be a wait if you have no reservations . 
 Any if you have a reservation you 'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a drink at the bar . 
 The food is awesome - definitely try the striped bass . 
 Decent wine selection too . 
 Went there last night for 2 year anniversery , and was n't all that impressed . 
 For the quality of food , a little too expensive . 
 You are paying for the atmosphere , which is nice , but can be had in numerous places in Bay R idge . 
 The only positive was the wait staff , which was prompt , knowledgable , and likeable . 
 If you want to save some money , do n't go here . 
 I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends , and spent three enjoyable hours there . 
 The restaurant was packed at first , so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated . 
 Most of the servers are very attentive , friendly and quite attractive . 
 The atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd , but there were a few groups of mid 20's year olds also . 
 Me and my girls will definitely go back . 
 I ordered in beef w broccoli today for lunch . 
 Considering their price of $ 6.25 for lunch special , the dish was ridiculously small . 
 The dish had like 6 pieces of beef in it . 
 All my co-workers were amazed at how small the dish was . 
 I would n't even have complained at all if the food at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy , too . 
 I was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out food from there . 
 Good food . 
 Nothing special about this place . 
 Owner must have coem on this website to give himself credit . 
 Not a 9.8 rating ! ! more like a 8.1 Trust me on that . 
 Is an Ok reataurant but not 9 or better ! ! ! GOOD PRICES ! ! ! 
 Have eaten at Ginger House several times , and it 's always good . 
 The fried dumplings are GREAT ! 
 Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant ! 
 Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you . 
 The food is reliable and the price is moderate . 
 What more can you ask for ? 
 One should not go to Lucky Strike for the food . 
 While certain staples are excellent ( the burger , some of the pastas ) , the food is not really the point . 
 Go with a group of friends and you will have a great time . 
 It is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late , raucus dinner . 
 I had a late dinner at Lucky Stike , a great name for a joint if ever I saw one . 
 Unfortunately , the food was NOT something to get worked up about . 
 Diner food at bistro prices is a bummer .... 
 We happened upon this place purely by accident and were pleased with the results . 
 I only tried a simple dish of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce , but it actually faired better than most NYC Italian joints I 've tried similar dishes at . 
 I would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard . 
 Lucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat . 
 Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously , but it should n't . 
 I recommend it ! 
 Just ignore the trendy wannabes . 
 As a retired hipster , I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city . 
 The wait staff is pleasant , fun , and for the most part gorgeous ( in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way , not in that she 's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@# $* way ) . 
 The food is yummy , especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries . 
 But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the BTs . 
 You can get a completely delish martini in a glass ( that 's about 2 1 drinks ) for $ 8.50 ( I recommend the Vanilla Shanty , mmmm ! ) in a great homey setting with great music . 
 The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music , and moreover , takes requests . 
 You ca n't go wrong with this place . 
 Pizza here is consistently good . 
 Salads are a delicious way to begin the meal . 
 You should pass on the calamari . 
 It is thick and slightly soggy . 
 Decor is charming . 
 Service is average . 
 I ca n't believe people complain about no cheese sticks ? 
 Who has room for Cheesesticks with the best pizza in NYC ! Get the pepperoni - YUM - and a family style salad . 
 Great staff . 
 Always great servic e ! 
 I go twice a month ! 
 Fantastic ! 
 I live a block away and go to Patsy 's frequently . 
 The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , fro zen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria 's . 
 The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , fro zen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria 's . 
 Also , because it is so thin , it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling . 
 So eat fast and order a lot . 
 Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS ! 
 Great pizza and fantastic service . 
 There was a small wait , but shorter than I expected . 
 Located at the end of a magnificent block . 
 Very cozy and warm inside .....I will be back ! 
 Love the scene first off - the place has a character and nice light to it ..very fortunate , location wise . 
 The pizza was pretty good and huge . 
 The price very reasonable . 
 We were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion ...a bucket of food literally . 
 We got most of it back at home with us . 
 I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i ca n't not mention or undermine . 
 The pasta penne was pretty extra buttery , creamy which means a big task to diggest. . tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count , penne ...got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed ...lol 
 LLOOVVE THIS PLACE. 
 Food is excellent . 
 Fish is so very fresh . 
 Waitstaff are very friendly . 
 Love YUKA. 
 honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives . 
 believe us , we 've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs . 
 not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly . the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality . 
 limited menu , no-so-fresh ingredients , thinly-sliced fish , fall-apart rice . the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce ( even its low sodium ) , the vinegar-soaked rice , and the scallion on top of the fish . the waitstaffs are nice though . 
 wont come back again for sure ! 
 The atmosphere is nothing special , but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo . 
 The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance . 
 Despite a slightly limited menu , everything prepared is done to perfection , ultra fresh and a work of food art . 
 I must give it Yon out of Yon stars ! 
 Taxan delicious ! 
 Arigato Gozimas Yuka ! 
 This is some really good , inexpensive sushi . 
 It costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll , but the roll more than triples in size , and that 's not just from the rice . 
 The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I 've had at this price range . 
 The Yellowtail was particularly good as well . 
 I have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu. 
 In any event , this is a place I 'll be sure to stop by again when I 'm in this part of town . 
 I had been searching really hard for a restaurant in New York where I could really feel unwanted and ignored and I finally found it ! 
 Read all the other review , they 'll confirm it . 
 The staff ignored my friends and I the entire time we were there . 
 It took half an hour to get our check , which was perfect since we could sit , have drinks and talk ! 
 Oh , but wait , we were out of drinks ( which were also delightfully overpriced ) . 
 It was like the servers forgot that they actually worked there and instead wanted to hang out and be cool . 
 You guys are awesome ! 
 It 's a shame that a nice , convenient place like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy service . 
 The last time I went we were seated at a table in a corridor next to the kitchen . 
 Every waitress and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair . 
 We asked to be moved ( which took half an hour ) , and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back , even though the rest of the room was practically empty . 
 My sister says it reminds her of a restaurant run by high-school students who do n't know what they are doing . 
 I agree . 
 i have eaten here a handful of times , for no reason besides sheer convenience . 
 ( i hang out , and live , in the neighborhood . . ) the food is decent . 
 however , it 's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth . 
 i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect , which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me , i.e . make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water , or the check . 
 i know , you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored , but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends , seeking a pleasant experience . 
 well , i did n't find it there , and trust , i have told everyone i can think of about my experience . the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty . 
 hmmm . 
 we love th pink pony . 
 THe perfect spot . 
 Food-awesome . 
 Service - friendly and attentive . 
 Ambiance - relaxed and stylish . 
 Do n't judge this place prima facie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart . 
 I stumbled upon this great pizzeria as I explored my new neighborhood . 
 All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better ! 
 I highly recommend the Sophia pizza . 
 It 's to die for ! 
 Rosario 's is without a doubt one of the greatest pizzerias in existence . 
 Sure , everyone 's got their favorite , but to know Sal , is to know New York . 
 He takes real pride in his food and his business . 
 He not only makes his own homemade mozzarella , but every pie is ultra fresh . 
 He ca n't help , they 're bought up so fast . 
 Even after getting pushed out by the no-class Famous Ray 's , Sal has risen again to carry on his father 's uncle 's legacies with a smile , true love for his community , and let 's not forget the Outstanding Pizza ! 
 He always says , I do n't have customers . 
 I only have friends . 
 This place is fun , watching people drunk and sober , trying to hook up , doing this and that ...I like this place but have had terrible service , depending on who serves me . 
 Some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers , other times , they 've skipped my order . 
 Other than the crappy service from two individuals , it 's great . 
 Good , fast service . 
 I would highly recommend . 
 Food is great and ine x pensive . 
 The location is perfect . 
 Give it a try and enjoy . 
 To dine at Thalia can be slightly deceiving because while its beautiful on the outside , its so bland on the inside . 
 The establishment scores big points in presentation and style . 
 Everything looks great , the drinks , the decor , the food , even the people . 
 However , service was as plain as sesame crusted Salmon I had . 
 The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners , which is not good considering the bill was nearly $ 100 . 
 With the food lacking in flavor and the service lacking in ... service , one would be overpaying for the experience and for the food . 
 This place is pretty deceiving ... it 's a gorgeous place in a great location and wonderful ambiance . 
 Service was on par but not wonderful . 
 My biggest complaint was the un-tasty food although presented well . 
 I had the salmon dish and while it was fine , for the price paid , I expected it to have some type of flavor . 
 It wo n't break the bank but I also wouldnt come back for the food . 
 My husband and I enjoy Sangria . 
 We were looking forward to nice glass of Sangria when we arrived . 
 The space is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise . 
 We asked the server for two glasses with a splash of Southern Comfort and Grand Marnier . 10 minutes later our drinks arrive and were not what we asked for . 
 We thought this a prelude to what the evening will be like . 
 So my husband made up an excuse so we can leave . 
 When we asked for the check TO OUR SURPRISE the check was $ 40 ! ! ! WE were charged for two glasses of sangria and 4 shots ... Needless to say we will never return . 
 We ate here in March , 2006 and ordered the pre-theatre 3-course dinner with wine flight . 
 I had the tuna tartare with sake , mushroom ravioli with pinot noir , and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $ 49 . 
 The first 2 courses were very good , but the chocolate sampler was too rich for me and the dessert wine far too sweet . 
 My husband had the mesclun , salmon , and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses . 
 I would like to return and try some of the other menu items when I do n't have to rush off to a show . 
 Fast service . 
 I think the restaurant was too loud ( when full ) to be romantic . 
 Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you , but the food does n't quite match up . 
 I ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor . 
 The entree was bland and small , dessert was not inspired . 
 I expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu. 
 I 've been a fan of Pastis for years it never fails to succeed in producing wonderfully friendly , knowledgeable servers ( I miss Eva n ! ) and top-notch French bistro fare . 
 The wine selection ( by the glass and bottle ) is wonderful and I always recommend that friends make a reservation if they 're going to be in town . 
 It saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy , crowded bar at dinnertime . 
 This is definitely a place that provides the best experience , though , to both A-listers and people walking in off the street . 
 Enjoy ! 
 There was a small group of us looking somewhere to eat kinda late on a weeknight and we ended up at Pastis . 
 We were pleasantly gre eted . 
 The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger , to steak , to escargot . 
 The food was very well prepared . 
 The service was ok . 
 It is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it 's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner . 
 My boyfriend and I were in NY for a few days and Pastis was a place that came recommended . 
 I loved it . 
 The atmosphere was crowded but it was a great bistro-type vibe . 
 The food was really good , I had the onion soup and it was one of the best ever . 
 Service was hur ried , but friendly . 
 The fries are yummy . 
 And where does Patis go wrong ; no where. 
 You are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but : Cassuolet , Steake Fritte , Tripe Stew , etc ; simple stuff . 
 And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful . 
 Had a late night dinner on a Saturday night . 
 Great vibe , lots of people . 
 My husband and I both ordered the Steak , medium . 
 My husbands was perfect , my was well done and dry . 
 I did n't complain , I liked the atmosphere so much . 
 Will give it another chance before I write it off . 
 My husband and I enjoyed each of the 6 taste size portions and left completely full . 
 The waitress suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food . 
 The restaraurant is very small so reservations are a must . 
 The entire dining experience was wonderful ! 
 The food is expensive , but worth every bite . 
 I had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that was n't as good . 
 You will be satisfied . 
 Worth it for a special occasion , or any time ! 
 A friend of mine took me for a birthday dinner here and it was ...quite amazing . 
 It 's charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic , even . 
 The food , served in small tasting portions ( as an option ) is very good with each dish being better than the next . 
 We had crawfish boiled and despite making a mess , it was a ton of fun and quite tasty as well . 
 All in all , I do n't see how you can go wrong . 
 I 've been frequenting The Tasting Room since it first arrived in the East Village and I 've never been disappointed . 
 The food and staff always surprise me with the new heights they are taken to . 
 Granted the space is smaller than most , it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants . 
 Less = More in their case . 
 I enjoy the collaboration of chef 's with Owner  Chef Colin Alevras from time to time but truly love it best when Colin is in full swing . 
 Very excited to hear that short-term Chef Jason Narone has moved on , he truly was a low point of their Sterling track record . 
 Went to Village last night for my birthday . 
 We picked it randomly , without a recommendation from someone who has been there , so we were n't sure what to expect . 
 We were very pleasantly surprised . 
 The food was delicious ( I had a halibut special , my husband had steak ) , and the service was top-notch . 
 When my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort . 
 Truly the mark of an attentive waiter . 
 I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night . 
 Threw my fiance 's surprise 30th birthday dinner here could n't be happier . 
 After calling every restaurant in the West Village district , found this restaurant . 
 Shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here : simple contract , deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20 . 
 No $ 6,000 minimum or 'we 'll have to split your group b 6 tables . ' 
 This is a true gem of the village . 
 - i asked for them spicy and they were delicious ) . 
 Our waiter and all of the people helping him were attentive and genuine . 
 They even sent us a dessert on the house because they thought we would like it ( and it was amazing-panna cotta ! ! !-so very yummy ) . 
 If you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food and excellent service , this is the place . 
 Village is one of those places that scores on all fronts . 
 We 've been following chef Lyle 's food around New York for 15 years and while remaining classic , his innovations with bistro fare have made us return and return . 
 If it 's just a quick martini at the bar ( which I recommend Jeffery 's ) or a mind blowing Roast Chicken , go to Village ! 
 I went to Del Frisco 's Friday night with my boyfriend for an 8:00 reservation . 
 Even though the restaurant was packed , we were seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems . 
 The service was excellent and the food was delicious . 
 Bring your appetites . 
 I do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy . 
 Even though it is a little loud , you do n't have to yell at each other to talk . 
 If you 're looking for a great meal at a decent price , go to Del Frisco 's ! 
 Try the cheesecake ! 
 Now at the top of our list , Del Frisco 's Stea khouse . 
 We did have to wait at the bar for approx . 
 20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our surroundings and each other . 
 The table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry , I understood they were busy . 
 The point is , the steak was phenominal , the cocktails and sides perfect and the price .......much less than what we expected to pay . 
 $ 160 for 2 filets , 2 sides , an appetizer and drinks . 
 Like others have said , do n't expect the restaurant to make a nite out romantic for you and yes , a busy restaurant may require you to wait . 
 If you can handle that , it 's a great place for a business dinner , fun with friends or simply a table for 2 . 
 I have lived in NY for many years and have dined at many restaraunts . 
 I went to DF for Valentines Day dinner . 
 The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had ( I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat ) . 
 The sides were ok and incredibly salty . 
 I could have drank 4 glasses of water and still been parched - so watch out . 
 The overall price tag was very very expensive , something I did expect . 
 However , for what we spent , overall , it just was not up to par . 
 Succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired 'doneness ' accompanied by salads and sides that do n't look like leafy road kill . 
 Finall y! 
 Forget the rush and the wait and the noise ( which is n't actually that bad ) , I mean please , who goes to a steakhouse to be coddled and romantic ? 
 Still , this place actually manages to outdo Sparks and SW etc . on the food-front while adding just enough of a civilized atmosphere where you wo n't worry about either your neighbor or the wait staff biting off one of your fingers . 
 When you want a piece of beef , head on over . 
 Tasty steak , pork loin , the works . 
 Filled with suits , though , so you never really feel terribly comfortable . 
 And I could do without the cigar smoke . 
 So , If you could eat the steak in a bubble , now ... Oh yeah , do n't forget a fat wallet , it ai n't cheap . 
 Even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine , if you can call $ 70.00 inexpensive , the cost is through the roof for better than average fare . 
 If presentation and service is your thing , then this magic show works . 
 For $ 600 ( the most we have ever paid ) not even waving a magic wand will ever get us back for a repeat performance . 
 The second you walk through the heavy vault like door , with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime. 
 and there 's no way out . 
 The production is a symphony , alot of fun to experience.The food sublime for the most part . 
 Everything is for sale in here including the sculptured iron statue on the table . 
 Take a good sense of humor ,an American express card with no limit , walk out with a lollipop,gift bag in hand and enough marketing materials for alain to to take the show on the road 
 I love and I know gourmet food by excellence ! 
 Alain Ducasse is the best of everything , I mean everything was excelent .I 
 ate there with my 2 sisters and a friend , the bill was almost $ 3000 , but believe me it was worth every single penn y ! 
 I am French and I really felt like home ! ! ! 
 I will definetely go back again and again , that 's for sure ! ! ! 
 For $ 760 for 2 people , it 's a once in a lifetime experience . 
 ( $ 200 for 2 glasses of champagne , not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks ) . 
 I 've dined at Alain Ducasse 's restaurant in Monte Carlo for half the price for the same excellent dining experience . 
 Dinner took almost 4 hours without any lag time . 
 I would definitely go back for a very special occasion , but not for regular fine dining . 
 Everything about this restaurant was special . 
 The service was attentive , yet disc reet . 
 The flavors robust and subtle . 
 The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal . 
 I 'm saving up for my next visit . 
 We had a girls ' night dinner here for restaurant week . 
 We were disappointed with the pre-fixe menu of only 2 choices per course ( other restaurants offer 3 choices ) and ended up ordering a la carte . 
 While we thoroughly enjoyed the food , it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation . 
 I 'm also convinced our waiter was a zombie ; he appeared to have difficulty focusing while we spoke to him . 
 My boyfriend and I recently had an early dinner at Artisanal and was satisfied with our experience . 
 We began with the cheese fondue ( the artisanal blend ) and added apples and kielbasa to dip . 
 Be careful of portions - they 're HUGE. 
 I was pretty much full after our fondue appetizer . 
 I had the cod with paella ( spicy and very filling , I 'm a big eater and could only eat half ) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips ( again , a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries ) . 
 We ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin . 
 Dinner , with wine , ended up costing around $ 130 ...not a bad deal when you consider how flavorful and large the portions are ! 
 NO A . 
 No apologies during restaurant week . 
 No free drink . 
 Butter was melted , white wine warm , cheese oozing everywhere . 
 A million better places to go in the city . 
 My friends and I experienced amazing cheese and a del icious , new summer menu at Artisanal last night . 
 We ran a little late for the reservation but it was n't a problem to get our table immediately . 
 Our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese . 
 ( This was nice b both the wine list and the cheese menu are very large . ) The summer feta salad and the shrimp dishes were excellent ( and refreshing after the cheese course ) ! 
 If you love wine and cheese and delicious french fare , you 'll love Artisanal ! 
 For being number 1 , this place has alot of work to do in order to truly earn its so called reputation . 
 Waiters tend to forget drinks completely , food portions are so tiny , two people have trouble sharing one entree . 
 That is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish , and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste . 
 This place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else . 
 The food was boring and expensive . 
 They charge $ 6.00 for rice . 
 The makhani was OK --the korma was bland . 
 The best thing I tasted were the lambc hops . 
 Not worth the prices . 
 Bukhara grill .. .... i went there on opening night 5-6 years ago and i am in love with it ever sinc e ... i mostly get food delivered from here . 
 there are so many thing i love about Bukhara . the furniture is awsome i love the wood furniture . 
 The foood is deff one of the best in NY. i love Dhal Bukhara and Chicken Makanhi . the entire staff is ver nice and helps me choose wen i need help . 
 Ive been here so many times the waiters know my name . 
 Deff recimmend Bukhara they also have opened two new locations guess ill try them out . 
 Overall A oh ya even though there is waiting it is deff worth it 
 First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks . 
 As a student in NYU i need a place to eat after a hard day of work so usually i just go to any indian restraunt near by . but ive heard a lot about this for the past 2 yrs and finally decided to eat here . 
 I am happy i did the food was awsome . 
 JUST AWSOM E. 
 and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs . 
 They are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in Yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey . 
 but overall i give it a 10 
 just got back from lunch at Tamarind and it was excellent . 
 we decided to eat in tea room which was small and cute . 
 we split a tasty vegetable samosa and the malai tikka wrap . 
 I definitely will go back . 
 Do n't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections . 
 Decor is nice though service can be spotty . 
 This place is always packed . 
 I know because I live nearby . 
 Most importantly , food is excellent . 
 Try the sea bass . 
 Highly recommended . 
 i'm surprised about some of the bad reviews posted here - i've been to tamarind about 5 or 6 times and always come away extremely satisfied and looking forward to returning . 
 try the spicy shrimp appetizer ( again , not the greatest value in the world but worth the price ) and the lamb vindaloo is great . 
 very good breads as well . 
 I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time . 
 We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves . 
 Yes , the prices are high , but I felt it was worth it . 
 We all felt it was worth it . 
 The dim sum here is only so-so . 
 The dim sum is ok but does n't taste that fresh , and the little dishes do n't look steamy hot as they should ( also note lack of Chinese here ) . 
 The one vegetarian entree ( Abby 's treasure ) was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had wintermelon covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables . 
 The meat dishes were only so-so . 
 Just bring someone who speaks Cantonese because waiter may not understand you . 
 Decor leaves something to be desired . 
 Excellent dumplings served amid clean , chic decor . 
 I got the $ 10 10-piece dim sum combo , every bite of which was great . 
 But $ 1 for each small piece ? ? ? 
 Not worth it . 
 I wo n't go back unless someone else is footing the bill . 
 Tasty but expensive . 
 Stick to dim sum , not super overpriced noodles . 
 Very different than regular dimsum places . 
 Usually 3 vs. 4 items per dish . 
 Okay service . 
 Worth a visit . 
 Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers , no matter what the reviews say . 
 They were such a rip-off ( $ 8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns ) and not worth trying . 
 The rest of the dim sum , though pricey by Chinatown standards , is worth it . 
 Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table . 
 The wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek ( for Chinatown ) alternative . 
 A few tips : skip the turnip cake , roast pork buns and egg custards . 
 These are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner : ( 1 ) turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of Mott St. just south of bayard ( 2 ) egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of Mott street just south of Canal . 
 I 've been to this monster sushi twice , the 46th st once , the 23rd st one a number of times . 
 this one is definintely my least favorite . 
 not worth it ; visit the other ones for real monster sushi goodness . 
 I went there with my friend last saturday . 
 first it took us a long time to find the place . 
 we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant , then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers . 
 but when we looked at the menu , there were n't a lot of choices , most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section . 
 then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi . 
 those rolls were big , but not good and sashimi was n't fresh . 
 they were dry and disgusting , i did n't even finish my first piece . 
 My roommate and I LOVE this place . 
 We recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have outdoor seating , perfect since I had my yorkie with me . 
 Indoor was very cozy and cute . 
 The portion sizes here are huge , and the sushi is good . 
 While it 's not Nobu , it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full . 
 Staff is very accomodating . 
 Largest and freshest pieces of sushi , and delicious ! 
 Very good service and very good prices . 
 Terrific menu full of unique rolls and special dishes . 
 Killer Sushi ! 
 This is the Cheers of New York , whether you 've ever been there or not . 
 Everyone is welcomed in as family . 
 The food , drinks and service are clearly among the best in the city . 
 During our meal , the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks . 
 While I 'm not sure that this happens all the time-this is the kind of treatment that buys repeat business ! 
 On a recent Sunday afternoon , a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT . 
 This was the perfect quiet , relaxing , and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater . 
 The chicken pot pie is excpetiona , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm . 
 With so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district , is truly an excellent find ! 
 We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town . 
 Hurley 's is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came . 
 Try the crunchy tuna , it is to die for . 
 Try everything for that matter , it is all good . 
 I have been going there since it opened and I ca n't get enough . 
 Hurley 's is terrific ! 
 I love going there ! 
 I recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal . 
 They all know you . 
 Good food . 
 Good drink . 
 How do you rate home ? 
 The bagels are fabulous . 
 We live in New Jersey and whenever we go into New York City we buy bagels to eat hot and then to freeze ( they told me that if I call in the order , they 'd bring it out to the car so I would n't have to look for parking ) . 
 They are the best bagels I 've had . 
 Their whitefish salad is excellent--all whitefish with a little mayo . 
 The bagels are also reasonably priced for NYC . 
 Growing up in NY , I have eaten my share of bagels . 
 Ess-A-Bagel ( either by Sty-town or midtown ) is by far the best bagel in NY. 
 The bagels always warm , soft on the inside , crispy on the outside and enormous in size . 
 They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great . 
 The lox is always fresh too . 
 Highly recommended to all ! 
 Our first time in New York and we had to try a New York Bagel . 
 We were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem . 
 The bagel was huge . 
 They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior . 
 The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese ( g ets a little messy ) . 
 I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND. 
 I grew up on these bagels . 
 The staff is no nonsense . 
 The food options rule . 
 When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else . 
 Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store . 
 the bagels are : big , brobdingnagian , colossal , elephantine , enormous , gargantuan , giant , gigantic , huge , humungous , jumbo , king sized , leviathan , mammoth , massive , titanic , tremendous , whopping ... best bagels in nyc . 
 always fresh and delicious . 
 so garantuan that you ca n't fit them in a toaster . 
 my personal favorite is an everything bagel with lox spread , but all the bagles are unbeliavably good . 
 My friends and I have been going here regularly for two years . 
 I 've been to plenty of great sushi spots in manhattan ; Faan is always my favorite for sushi and chinese . 
 The sushi for two is a GREAT value . 
 I LOVE their spicy scallop roll , and my boyfriend consistently gets the sesame chicken . 
 Their sake martini is wonderful . 
 I find the service to be so friendly and very quick , and we are often greeted w on the house . 
 It is by far my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn . 
 The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced . 
 Try their chef 's specials-- they are to die for . 
 Service is not exactly five star , but thats not really a big deal . 
 Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction 
 Faan 's got a great concept but a little rough on the delivery . 
 My GF and I still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktails , the chill decor , and the decent sushi . 
 But the thai is definitely not great -- bland and indistinguished . 
 They do n't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai . 
 The service is not consistently excellent -- just decent . 
 Get the feeling they settled into a groove a while ago . 
 They need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent . 
 Faan is sooo good . 
 The best pad thai i've ever had . 
 The design and atmosphere is just as good . 
 bottles of wine are cheap and good . 
 What more could you want ? 
 SEA has become so popular that they 've let it go to their heads . 
 It 's super-trendy and there 's always someone to take that empty seat , so it seems that customer service has been deemed not of the essence . 
 The food is usually good but it certainly is n't a relaxing place to go . 
 After being told that our party of three would be seated in 10 minutes and watching other parties ( multiples of 2 and higher ) seated for 40 minutes , the three of us were squished into a small 2-person table . 
 And , atlhough tables opened up next to us and we ASKED for a slightly larger space , they left us awkardly seated . 
 Needless to say , I 'm never going back and you should be wary too . 
 This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food . 
 The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that I could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish . 
 And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic . 
 If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go . 
 What a great place . 
 I came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband . 
 I was n't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes , but I guess that 's the price you pay for a popular place . 
 I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine ! 
 Delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door . 
 The red sliding doors may be unique but they do not block off the cold air from the outside . 
 I was with a party of 7 ( close but not next the the front doors ) and we were eating with our coats on . 
 Too cold to enjoy . 
 Went there and had a combination of different seafood dishes and appetizers . 
 The food was spicy and delicious . 
 It might have been a little too spicy for my friend , which you can couteract with eat more rice and keeping water on hand . 
 The place is a little tight and on a cold day , the seating by the entranceway can be pretty drafty . 
 The price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate . 
 My suggestion is to eat family style because you 'll want to try the other dishes . 
 Sure , the setting is nice . 
 It 's convenient . 
 What I did n't like was how the food came right after it was ordered . 
 This made it obvious that the food was n't cooked fresh ; it was obviously made before hand and then reheated . 
 Definitely not worth the pric e ! 
 Do n't go . 
 As a fan of Thai , I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst . 
 The food was not fresh , the sauces were bland and very oily . 
 It just was n't Thai . 
 I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great . 
 This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money . 
 The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals . 
 I have to say that I am pleasantly suprised and I will most likely stop in again if I am in the neighborhood . 
 Suan is a great place that I often take my friends ( classmates ) too . 
 Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to Suan again and again . 
 I LOVE their Thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST ! 
 I was in love with Pongsri on 48th , but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced . 
 I will go back to Suan soon ! 
 In summer-eat outside on a terrace ( another great feature of Suan ) ! ! ! 
 Suan was a recommendation that I am glad we heeded . 
 I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village , and while I do believe their food has slightly slipped in quality , I have been hesitant to be disloyal . 
 Suan has challenged this loyalty . 
 I was very impressed by this low-key upper eastsider and their authentically thai cuisine ! ! ! 
 They do cater to American palates , but if you like it hot let them know and they are more than willing to oblig e ! 
 Try the green curry ! ! ! 
 Good crowd , good outdoor seating , with a hip japanese vibe . 
 Staff was cool enough to exlplain all the different sakes ( they have a small but delicious selec tion ) and make amazing recommendations . 
 There 's something smooth about sipping sake upper east side style . 
 I brought some buddies from CA and they loved it . 
 Kudos Haru 
 We ate outside at Haru 's Sake bar because Haru 's restaurant next door was overflowing . 
 What 's the difference between the two ? 
 Their sake list was extensive , but we were looking for Purple Haze , which was n't listed but made for us upon request ! 
 The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share ! 
 We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great ! 
 Tasty sushi  appetizers ...overall the food is quality ...varied saki selection , too . 
 Good , dark atmosphere and the music is a nice touch . 
 My only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you ! 
 I know this is the case in many nyc eateries , but here , they really cram you in to the point where it 's borderline uncomfortable . 
 It ai n't cheap either , but then again , cheap food ai n't good and good food ai n't cheap . 
 If you 're craving for Haru 's great food , especially the House Roll , but ca n't stand the wait building outisde , head across the street to their Sake Bar ! 
 They offer the same menu but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you . 
 Their sushi , Kamikaze and other Rolls are fresh and well presented . 
 Though the Spider Roll may look like a challenge to eat , with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll , it is well worth the price you pay for them . 
 This place is a literal hole-in-the-wall that is buried within Doyers , right off of Pell St ( barber 's alley ) in Chinatown . 
 The photobook menu was a cute touch , certainly helped my group and I pick the fried chicken , pork chop , and noodle dishes that we all ordered . 
 The cuisine from what I 've gathered is authentic Taiw a nese , though its very different from what I 've been accustomed to in Taipei . 
 The menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked . 
 Overall , I 'm still impressed that the place even exists and the prices are quite decent but then again , its Chinatown . 
 The restuarant itself is not large , but seems to have several round tables to accomodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic Taiw a nese . 
 If you 're not familiar with the cuisine , you may encounter problems ordering here and be sure to bring plenty of cash with you as they do n't accept credit cards . 
 You fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town . 
 However it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town . 
 The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre . 
 You ca n't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown . 
 They 're are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing , Queens . 
 Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town ! 
 Beef noodle soup is good as well . 
 The service is good and the resturant is clean . 
 Best Taiwanese food in NY! 
 Authentic Taiwanese food that 's cheap ... what more could you ask for ? 
 ( Besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city ) . 
 The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan . 
 I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded . 
 However , it is jus too good to not praise it . 
 By far , the best pizza in Manhattan . 
 The crust is thin , the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly . 
 For all you lazy folks that do n't want to come to Alphabet City , I say , good - stay out . 
 less wait time for me ! 
 Really . 
 Our favorite meal is a pesto pizza , the house salad , and a good bottle of wine . 
 All conveniently delivered right to the door . 
 They are FAST . 
 I 've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times , but more often I order delivery . 
 The food is great . 
 Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights . 
 I heartily recommend . 
 There is a downside if you 're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude . 
 Never have I had such dramatic delivery guys ( a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b I live in a walkup ) who always seem disappointed with their tips . 
 Hey , I think $ 2+ for a 5 block walk ai n't bad . 
 Stumbled upon this gem of a pizza place and I will be going back frequently . 
 The thin crust pizza is amazing -- you can choose any toping your own . 
 The service was great as well . 
 Not a large place , but it 's cute and cozy . 
 Not a typical pizza joint , but good for a low key and fairly cheap nice sit down dinner . 
 I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two . 
 For dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan . 
 MMmmm ... it was delicious . 
 Service was slow , but the people were friendly . 
 It 's a nice place to relax and have conversation . 
 I ca n't wait to go back . 
 Excellent lunch buffet for only $ 6.95 . 
 We always go there on the weekends and leave extremely full and satisfied . 
 The selection changes frequently but the basic dishes are always available . 
 Just remember not to wear your best clothes b you 'll come out smelling like Indian food ... but it 's well worth it ! 
 Great Indian food and the service is incredible . 
 The owner truly caters to all your needs . 
 When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets , and then ordered for them . 
 Everyone was more then happy with his choices . 
 Great food and the prices are very reasonable . 
 Dakshin is one of the few affordable and tasty Indian restaurant in the upper east side . 
 Although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out prices are different . 
 Prices are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala is quite good . 
 Ambiance is barely romantic but management tries . 
 Dahkin also offers prix fixe lunch and buffet . 
 Stay away from the latter since you wo n't go for seconds ( hint hint ) . 
 Prix fixe lunch comes with entree , nan roti and basmati rice - a good deal for $ 6 . You 're be paying twice for the same option during dinner . 
 We arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly.The 
 menu has so many fish items and oysters.We 
 all ordered different entrees so we could share.The 
 fish was really ,really fresh .I lived in Maine for ten years and grew up on fish.We all agreed that mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in New York . 
 Ive passed by the spot tons of times always wanting to go in . 
 We made early dinner reservations and were thoroughly impressed , reminds me of my grandfather , its old school Italian scenery with lots of fun stuff to admire . 
 I ate clams oreganta and spectacular salad with perfectly marinated cucumbers and tomatoes with lots of shrimp and basil . 
 My boyfriend ate tuna and it was cooked perfectly ! 
 Service was great ; wine was good , only concern would be that there were too few light beers . 
 We sprung 7 people on them , plus a Seeing Eye Dog ! Still they accommodated us , and were friendly to boot ! 
 The octopus eaters were floored by the Octopus salad . 
 And the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating . 
 Other seafood dishes were very good ( N O COMPLAINTS FROM ANYONE! ) . Deserts were terriffic . 
 The $ 300 bill was a bit steep , but the experience was great . 
 --Eat Club is a roving group of NYC gluttons 
 To celebrate a birthday , three of us went to Mare anticipating great food . 
 Not one of our meals was edible - bland and made with weird rosemary or orange flav o ring . 
 Fish was overdone . 
 Cute place , nice wait staff but would never go there again . 
 Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that . 
 One of us actually liked the expresso - that 's it . 
 Skip this restaurant , it 's a big disappointment . 
 i can only vouch for my favorite dishes : egg drop soup , dumplings and general tso 's chicken . 
 delicious . 
 and i have been around the block , to say the very least . 
 friends have sampled other choices on the menu and have found them to their taste . 
 happy to be a regular at this place and would warmly recommend it to anyone . 
 p.s. : not affiliated with mgm t . 
 just a regular person . 
 Looked up on citysearch ... figured try a new place in Chinatown , HUGE , I MEAN HUGE MISTAKE. 
 The food was just awful , ATROCIOUS actually . 
 The service was typical short-order , dinner type . 
 But I just would like to say I read the reviews people left and thats why I checked it out . 
 Look I dont know if the people who wrote the reviews have ever been to a decent place ( PLEASE TRY SOMEOTHER PLACES ) . 
 But WARNING : to all those that use this site be weary , be very weary of recommendations . 
 If you have a dumpling fetish i suggest you try some here ! 
 The skin of the dumplings are made fresh here and you can tell b it melts in your mouth ! 
 The fried rice is amazing here . 
 I 've been coming here as a child and always come back for the taste . 
 The dim sum servings here are a bit larger than I 'm used to . 
 Several of the dim sum orders had about 6-8 pieces . 
 That 's good and bad . 
 Good , because hey , it 's more food , but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap . 
 We saw them heating up at least one frozen item though I 'm not sure which dim sum dish it was . 
 Nevertheless the food itself is pretty good . 
 Spice is great Thai food , love the inexpensive appetizers . 
 Regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the hostess will take your name and tell you Five minutes . 
 Until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your wait may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating . 
 Its worth the wait though . 
 All the NYU students love this place so it makes for a fun young atmosphere . 
 I have been to spice three times - twice during lunch and once at dinner . 
 I have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials . 
 They are served with a free appetizer and the portions are perfect for lunch . 
 Their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu . 
 I love this place . 
 The only concern i have is with the slighly all-business waitstaff who order and throw the food down , rushing you out . 
 I have to say that if this what makes it easier to get a saet a lunch- I dont mind . 
 The place is sleek , modern and playfull and i will return again frequently . 
 Great food at reasonable prices . 
 For appetizers , I recommend the shrimp fritters and dumplings . 
 It 's usually packed for good reason , esp. 
 at night , but it 's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the music playing in the background is also voluminous . 
 And I would have to agree with the masses in terms of service - delivery is their Achilles ' heel . 
 My co-workers had to wait almost an hour for delivery , only to discover that what they got was not what they ordered . 
 However , their popularity has yet to slow down , and I still find myself drawn to their ambiance and delectable reputation . 
 Spice is sleek , modern and cool with a menu that will not hurt your wallet . 
 An excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but , the food was slightly disappointing . 
 The Pad thai , lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but , I 've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places . 
 Ok , for all of us growing up in the Village of NYC , we have spoiled by a plethora of restaurants , most of which stay open very late . 
 I will have to say , this Bengali Fast Food joint is clearly my favorite . 
 The bread is the soft paratha bread ( unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta ) , and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful . 
 This is the pinnacle of Indian Fast Food ( all fast foods in my opin i o n ) . 
 The place does get crowded , so I recommend going between 4-5 PM . 
 For all of you new to Indian food , try the Paneer Roll , it is a piece of heaven . 
 I like Mamoun 's food as well , but side by side , Kati Rolls just produce tastier food hands down . 
 I live nearby and when they first opened , I ate there a lot . 
 It 's true , this place is not cheap . 
 I need at least three rolls to be full , and that 's at least $ 14.00 ! 
 They are tasty , but I suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average American digestive system . 
 This place does n't compare with Mamoun 's in terms of price , freshness , value , and consisent quality , but that 's just my opinion . 
 As a long-time patron of Mamoun 's , I always figured that I had found the best late night food spot in the city . 
 However , it just so happens that there 's an even more amazing place just down the street . 
 Kati Roll serves numerous fillings ( tandoori chicken , paneer , etc . ) wrapped in piping hot parathas . 
 The parathas and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed . 
 The main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level . 
 There is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times . 
 This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls . 
 I really recommend the very simple Unda ( Egg ) rolls . 
 Delicate spices , onions , eggs and a kick-ass roti . 
 Amazing ! 
 i actually feel like i should keep it a secret . 
 This is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money . 
 An excellent service 
 I am a die hard peep lover . 
 I have taken practically every guest that has come to visit me in NY and hooked a few New Yorkers onto Peep as well . 
 The secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered . 
 The bill is approximately $ 25 for 2 at lunch without drinks . 
 This is the best thing in Soho . 
 Not pretentious and very economical . 
 I had the Pad Thai and the noodles were sticky . 
 The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal . 
 We had the pot-stickers which were great and a tempura dish that was great . 
 The prices were fantastic . 
 The seating was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant , so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here . 
 My husband said the portions were very small , but if my main course was good to eat the portion would 've been fine for me . 
 I love the atmorphere @ peep ! 
 The staff is very kind and well trained , they 're fast , they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks , they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations . 
 My first time there I happened not to like the Crab Croquette apt that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal . 
 And the staff is also young , energeic and hot ! ! ! ! 
 It 's the perfect restaurant for NY life style , it got cool design , awsome drinks and food and lot 's of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink bar ... 
 I got enough reasons to keep coming back ! ! ! 
 OU MUST TRY THIS RESTAURANT . 
 IT IS WHAT MODERN CUISINE IS ALL ABOUT . 
 THE FOOD IS CREATIVE ( W ASIAN FLARE ) AND BEAUTIFULLY ARRANGED . 
 THR AT MOSHPHERE IS COMPACT , MODERN , YET COZY . 
 IT IS DEFINITELY SPECIAL AND AFFORDABLE. 
 PERFECT FOR DATES ! 
 I have walked by this place for eons and finally went thanks to a girls ' night . 
 Great wine , great food . 
 I do n't like Indian food too much and this was del icious , however you want to factor that into the equation . 
 A glass of Leaping Lizard , a glass of prosecco , and the mussels had everything happy . 
 Granted we were just the girls , but this would also be a great date spot b the ambiance is chic and bustling yet you can also hear the conversation at your own table rather than a loud din or worse , someone else 's conversation . 
 The only weird thing was if we got a bottle , the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price X4 , which makes no sense whatsoever . 
 If you go here - your focus should be the Tamarind Margaritas . 
 They are amazing ! 
 The food is alright - some stuff is good - some is not ( like the steak dish which tends to be dry ) . 
 And I say snacking because it really is not set up to be a proper dinner . 
 Just stick with the small dishes ! 
 We visited Bread Bar during January restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections and service . 
 Food quality was excellent , service was good ( could be a little more attentive . ) Portions were moderate ...enough . 
 Especially liked chicken tikka and the naan , and the dals . 
 Could be pricey without a prix fixe meal . 
 Based on a visit a month ago , I returned the week before Christmas and was hugely disappointed . 
 The menu changed , portions were even smaller than before , a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility , a basmati rice dish lacked flavor . 
 The noise level was unbearable , conversation impossible . 
 You can get an excellent meal at most of the many Indian restaurants on nearby Lexington Avenue for the cost of one the dainty dishes here . 
 On a recent Saturday night , I was with a group of 5 at the Bread Bar . 
 We ordered a number of appetizers , mostly chutneys and naan , and they were all enjoyable ( the tomato chutney was amazing ) aside from one thing .....by the time we were about to finish one dish , the next would be layed out on our table . 
 Aside from the rushed service , we were very impressed with the food and the drinks . 
 The chicken and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection , and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites . 
 Overall a worthwhile experience . 
 Tuk Tuk is my second favorite neighborhood Thai place ( the first being Joya ) . 
 This place , however , has a lot less pretension than Joya and the Thai food is still above-average . 
 You rarely have to wait for a seat and the currys ( masaman , green , red ) are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it . 
 The Pad Thai is excellent here , as well . 
 I 've never been disappointed . 
 While the menu is n't especially groundbreaking , everything I 've tried so far has been well-executed and tasty . 
 Service has always been friendly and efficient . 
 The space is a bit too small for live music , so on jazz nights , it can be loud and cramped . 
 Also , the place is popular with families , so if you 're bothered by children running loose like wild animals , come later at night to avoid them . 
 I 'm Thai and live in Queens , NY. Every Thai people here knows you can find good Thai restaurants everywhere in Queens . 
 Tuk Tuk is one of the rare choices for me to go in Brooklyn . 
 The food is great and authentic . 
 Love the Jazz bands on Fri and Sat . 
 this place ... we stumbled upon it on labor day weekend . 
 whoever the jazz duo was , they were on POINT . 
 even the wine by the glass was good . 
 its a little out of the way if you do n't live in the neighborhood , but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are . 
 The New York Times has reviewed this place three times already , you know it 's going to be good . 
 This is the only Thai place I go too in NYC , it 's wonderful , and live relaxed Jazz on certain nights . 
 Authentic food and they have REAL service , not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door . 
 Live relaxed Jazz just tops it off ; ] Enjoy . 
 this place is amazingly bad . 
 like saying her bread comes from a special bakery when we have seen her buying it dowtown manhathan . 
 Well , their deliveries take for ever and the food is usually cold . 
 i dont how this place is still running . 
 Unless you are eating in the Pizzeria side of this place , and are not in a rush , this place is a bad idea . 
 Deliveries often take up to an hour and the prices are higher than most other pizzerias in the area . 
 And despite Gabriella 's claim that she uses only the finest ingredients ; the Grand Dame has been seen purchasing cases of Kraft string cheeze at Cosco . 
 As for the bar , this is another bad idea . 
 The seating is cramped ; the drinks exceptionally pricey and watered down , and there is only ONE unisex bathroom ( YUCK! ! ! ) . 
 Your money could easily be better spent elsewhere ( Anywhere ) . 
 I love this cozy around the way Rest . 
 Where Gabriela personaly greets you and recommends you what to eat . 
 A one women show ! 
 despite the untasteful previous review ... 
 It is about FOOD and Ambiance , and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine . 
 The food is mostly made from scratch , fresh and well prepared . 
 The bar has various selections and the mixed drink special is a catcher ! 2 for 1 's . 
 Gotta love it ... ! I am having my husband 's birthday party there .... SO GET READY FOR THE LOUDNESS ! ! ! ! BORING NEIGHBORS ! 
 I do n't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer . 
 I for one will never patronize them again . 
 Little Tonino 's is just awesome , our favorite delivery place in Kennsington , honestly the best Gnochi I have ever had ! 
 It 's called Gnochi alla nona and is found under Chef Specials . 
 Pizza and garlic knots are great as well , I order from them quite often and the delivery is always super quick ! 
 Everyone I have spoken too there is super friendly , help ful , and willing to the extra mile for a customer . 
 Once they ran out of Gnochi and made it for me from scratch ! 
 Highly Highly Highly recommended ! 
 I finally got a chance to experience the quality of good food ,no great food that everyone should try ,after getting off at Fort Hamilton exit everyday of my life always saying i am going to try that pizzeria with the adorable kid in on the sign i am astonished at the superb and taste of just about everything i have tried so far that 's # 1 Pizza,chicken cutlet parm and my favorite chicken Marsala no one can seem to get it correctly but this place seemed to perfect its kinda surreal highly ,highly ,highly recomennded .... 
 After dealing with subpar pizza all over the Kensington neighborhood - I 've found little toni nos . 
 I could n't reccommend their Godmother pizza any higher . 
 Service is friendly , prices are good - delivery time was a little slow , but for the way this pizza tastes , I 'm willing to overlook it . 
 Worth making the trip down to Kensington for ...really ! 
 Tonino 's took over from the adorable but empty Brooklyn Egg Cream Co. countertop corner joint and , at first , we were sad . 
 But they 've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the Godmother pizza ( a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usua l ) . 
 Obviously run by folks who know a pie . 
 This place is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the Prospect Expressway and Greenwood Cemetery - a wasteland we like to call The Sliv. 
 Always my fav place for a quick coffee ( $ 2.50 ! ! ) they now have an off-menu b OATMEAL TO DIE FOR ! 
 I work near-by , and they have the BEST oatmeal in the neighborhood - not a packaged or quick-cooked item . 
 They treat me like family , morning and night . 
 I 've had my wife meet me after work for dinner a couple of times ; she loves this place too . 
 Great value for the quality ingredients . 
 Check it out . 
 Visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews . 
 On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch . 
 Ambience is so cute and quaint , good for business although we were there on vacation . 
 Salads were fantastic . 
 Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great . 
 Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me . 
 We will be back . 
 By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant . 
 fine dining restaurant quality . 
 Over 100 different choices to create your own . 
 A must try ! 
 We do not need to go to a four-star restaurant anymore. 
 NO more reservations , expensive tips and annoying stuff . 
 It has been my first choice ever since I discovered it . 
 Delivery service is great too . 
 I think locals rate this place so high . 
 After the review I treked into Brooklyn . 
 First off , the waitress was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw her(odd in a restaurant with 6 tables ) and got our order wrong . 
 The plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom( third generation-Fornini ) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle( again making it soggy ) and nothingon the rest . 
 I love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the food fine cuisine , even with no idea how to use them . 
 Anyway , this is the last time I cross the williamsburg . 
 We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday , and I was thoroughly impressed with the food . 
 The pesto pizza was excellent , thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I 'd never heard of before . 
 Conveniently located too , being right on Bedford ave . 
 THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant , where you can see their personal herb garden . 
 I will definetly be going back . 
 I come from a family of pizzeria owners , and I 'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino 's blows my families receipies away . 
 It is simply amazing . 
 The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious . 
 I highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try . 
 You will find yourself returning quite often . 
 P.S. Please do n't tell anyone in my family i eat there . 
 LOL 
 Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza . 
 Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though ) . 
 My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better . 
 The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day . 
 Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids . 
 Overall I would recommend it and go back again . 
 Coming from Boston this place is like Emma 's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge ( although they have more funky toppings ! ) 
 Best Reuben sandwich ever ! 
 A classic ! Do n't miss Bloom 's on your next trip to Manhatten . 
 It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York , and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York . 
 Thanks Bloom 's for a lovely trip . 
 I have never had cheescake like this . 
 I thought I had died and gone to heaven . 
 Had a fantastic omlette here ... sandwiches are about 6 inches high and filled with layers of deli meat goodness . 
 The service was a bit slow , but they were very friendly . 
 No refills on fountain drinks , though . 
 Great food , great prices , great service . 
 If you are looking for a good quality , cheap eats - this is the place . 
 I thought this place was totally overrated . 
 Everything we had was good or ok ....but definitely nothing great . 
 The ambience was nice , but service was n't so great . 
 When you add it all together , it just does n't seem worth it to me ...especially considering the prices . 
 I loving bringing friends here - and I do so every chance I get . 
 I have had so many dinners here and it 's always been perfect - on a date with my husband , with my mom , with girlfriends and larger groups . 
 And all of that wo n't break your bank ! 
 I cannot recommend OG more highly if I tried - check it out for yourself . 
 My girlfiends and I ate at O.G. again last night . 
 I have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here . 
 We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu. 
 Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon , Sea Bass and Crispy Duck . 
 We got a little tipsy from the sake but is n't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about ? 
 This quiet dark asian bistro is well worth the trip . 
 We a menu that rearely changes ,e xcept for one or two specials , the quality and care they put in thier food in evident . 
 The crackling calamari salad , which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants , is crispy and lightly dressed . 
 The barebecued salmon is elegantly spiced and not at all dry . 
 BUt their best dish is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would cost $ 23.95 is most places , but it is $ 16 here . 
 Only wine and beer are served , but the house varities are actually quite good . 
 Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff . 
 The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate . 
 The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate . 
 Not a great place for family or general dining . 
 We arrived for dinner expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past - but , that 's just it -- the PAST ! 
 The restaurant is dark and not very attractive and then you have spot lights shining on you putting you in the worst light possible , reaching for sunglasses . 
 The menu prices are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and portion size . 
 I ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime . 
 They could n't even make a salad that was appealing . 
 We spent $ 200 in this place and left hungry and very disappointed . 
 Last memorial day , I tried to make reservations but was told they were closed that weekend ( interesting , but .. . ) . 
 I figured I would give it another try . 3 weeks ago I made reservations for Saturday night . 
 Today , I get a call telling me that they are closed that day ( Saturday ? ) and subsequent Saturday 's for the rest of the year . 
 Unbelievable . 
 It is so easy to get a reservation at a top place in NYC with a week 's notice . 
 I am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort . 
 This place is to be avoided . 
 Overall a disappointing experience for that price category . 
 The Halibut was too salty , dessert was so so ( do n't waste any of your calories ) and service was poor . 
 The waiter actually poured water on my hand and walked away . 
 I actually gave Patroon another chance before writing this , but the second visit was even worse . 
 Went last Thursday . 
 Great roofdeck , nice group of 30 somet hings , but no music , kind of quiet . 
 We left after one drink . 
 I would go back tho . 
 It 's better than being on the roof of Sutton Place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night . 
 Check it out 
 Cornelia Street looks like a Broadway set for West Side Story and the inside of Po is so cool quaint you really ca n't top the setting for a romantic dinner in NYC . 
 Just do n't take the seat between the bar and the back half of the restaurant , i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there . 
 Anyway , food is great , creative , fresh as always with Battali ....yet my combo of dishes were too salty ....the waiter could n't fill my water glass enough . 
 The white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal . 
 I almost think you can get away with a salad pasta ....by the time you get to the entrees you are struggling to finish , given the decent portion sizes of salads , pasta plus the bread brushetta to start . 
 The food is amazing ... especially if you get the Chef 's tasting menu and your favourite bottle ( or two ! ) of wine from an extensive selection of wines . 
 The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the service is excellent and it 's great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion . 
 People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans . 
 The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n't like . 
 Recommendations , of course , are required ! 
 Please be aware that it 's CASH or AMEX onl y ! 
 What an amazing meal and experienc e ! 
 I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal ! 
 Kudos to Po ! 
 I went here with my boyfriend and another couple . 
 We all had the tasting menu and unlike some of the other reviews , I felt there was more than enough food . 
 The quail was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of flavor . 
 We were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service was very quick and professional .

 I went here with a friend on a whim , we went someplace else first and could n't get a table . 
 Service here was great , food was fantastic . 
 Guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great , we both had the filet , very good , did n't much like the frites that came with , but the filet was so good , neither of us cared .

 Maybe tomorrow ;- ) 
 Big and gawky on the outside . 
 Tends to turn people away . 
 Go inside and you wo n't want to leave . 
 The food is fresh , del icious , and reasonably priced . 
 The desserts are more appealing then stuffy overpriced French restaurants . 
 Nice find . 
 In fact , you ca n't miss it . 
 I have been about 4 times and have always had a great meal . 
 I think this is one of the more underrated places in the city . 
 They have a very diverse menu so its something for everybody . 
 The steak is good , the fish is good and the sushi was surprisingly great . 
 They also do a great job for restaurant week . 
 I have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye . 
 The first time I went , and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere , I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad . 
 I 've never ordered anything else from their menu...there 's no need to . 
 It 's simply the best meal in NYC . 
 You cannot go wrong at the Red Eye Grill . 
 Go there on an empty stomach and leave feeling like a baby Veal Calf( ok bad joke ) , but you will see . 
 The food is great ! ! The service well what can I say .... 
 Just go and see for yourself . 
 Oh yeah ever on the west side try there sister resturant Arties Cafe . 
 goda la durata dolce di alimento! ! ! ( Enjoy the sweet life of food ) 
 This is the Jackel and Hideof the restaurants on the UES . 
 The brunch could not be worst ! From the food to the service , everything seems out of place .But , 
 by dinner time , they turn it around and mount a huge comeback ! ! 
 The Italian food has flavor ( that can be sort of surprising on the UES ) , and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive ,they sort of remind me of the NY Yankees of the late 90's , no matter how bad it look , you knew that there was a rally just around the corner ... 
 Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES , I get angry that I did n't just go to Zucchero Pomodori . 
 This is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood . 
 You 'll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city , and most still do n't compare . 
 I 'm partial to the Gnocchi . 
 Excellent experience . 
 Service was warm and attentive , beef carpaachio was exellent ( huge portion ) and pasta was fresh and well-prepared . 
 Plus they made a perfect martini . 
 Skip Baroanda down the street ( Eurotrashy , snooty and expensive ) and check this place out ! 
 Myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the City ; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else . 
 I 've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious . 
 Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for . 
 The service was the only thing good about this restaurant . 
 It 's boring on the inside , and our sushi was pretty below average ... the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor . 
 I definitely would n't go back . 
 Just moved to the neighborhood and we 've been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants . 
 If you do n't mind pre-sliced low quality fish , unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place . 
 Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit . 
 Was n't going to share but I feel obligated ...while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing . 
 No thanks ! ! ! 
 Miyagi is my sushi restaurant of choice in the Village ; it 's never insanely crowded , the service is very sweet ( I 've never experienced any of the nastiness described in prior reviews ) , and the tabs are small . 
 Unfortunately , so are the pieces of sashimi and sushi , sometimes ; on the other hand , it 's all delicious and fresh , and you wo n't leave stuffed . 
 I 've yet to have a bad or indifferent meal here ; nothing will knock your socks off , but you 're guaranteed a good , swimmingly fresh time . 
 Molto bene ! 
 This quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list . 
 The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare , the dishes are never a disappointment . 
 Whether it 's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar , you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite . 
 A guaranteeed delight ! 
 First of all , this place is *not* romantic , as claimed by Citysearch 's editorial review . 
 Either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th . 
 The tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced . 
 Slightly above average wines start at $ 70+ with only one selection listed at $ 30+ . 
 Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category . 
 For instance , plates were just dumped on the table , I was handed the wine list upside down , etc .... Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service . 
 To be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora . 
 Found service above average , but that could be because we were 13 of us . 
 My host asked for appetizers for the group and the waiter gave us not only what we ordered , but some other items that were not ordered . 
 Normally that would be improper , however they were all delicious and my host did not complain . 
 We all ate pasta entre 'es , which were great . 
 All in all the food was above average and I would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners . 
 This is a consistently great place to dine for lunch or dinner . 
 All the pastas are fantastic and the homemade lasagna is some of the best that I have had in the City . 
 The all-Italian staff is warm and engaging from the start . 
 Its a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for lunch . 
 Try the lasagnette appetizer . 
 Buon appetito ! 
 My friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian . 
 Too bad the food was n't of the same heritage . 
 The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless , so was the seafood tagliatelle . 
 A real dissapointment . 
 But that was n't the icing on the cake : a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had . 
 They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies . 
 Priced at upper intermediate range . 
 love the food . 
 it 's the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food . 
 it helps if you know what to order . 
 and you ca n't beat the prices . 
 highly recommended . 
 Very popular style Izakaya ( Sake and small portion of sake-friendly dishes ) . 
 Good for casual dinner with jeans and sneakers . 
 If you like Sakagura but you feel it 's too much , you 'd better try Yokocho . 
 Deep Fried Skewers are good and still rare to find in NYC . 
 They also have Korean BBQ and very beer-friendly Korean appetizer(like Kim Chee ) . 
 As a Japanese native , I 've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years , but I was just so amazed at this place . 
 This place is the most Japanese it can ever get . 
 This place is worth an one-hour drive . 
 I am so coming back here again , as much as I can . 
 Consistently good Japanese Tapas . 
 Same owner as the guy who owns Typ hoon , which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave . 
 It 's also attached to Angel 's Share , which is a cool , more romantic bar ... 
 This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart 's and I must say how delicous the food and the service was . 
 When I called this morning , I did n't think I would be able to get in at 12 , but I was able to get in , along with four other guests . 
 I have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo ; you can tell it was a fresh lob ster . 
 Other guests enjoyed pizza , santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips . 
 9.5 ? 
 What for ? 
 For Park avenue I expected so much more . 
 I just do not understand what the fuss is all about . 
 Definitely Highly NOT recommended . 
 When I 'm feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office , I head for Cafe St. Bart 's . 
 When you 're sitting in their main dining room ( which has a spectacular , hand-painted high ceili n g ) you 'd never know there was a world outside . 
 The food is wonderful , tasty and filling , and the service is professional and friendly . 
 I ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio . 
 Ahhh ... 
 This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service . 
 The only thing you can do here is walk in and eat . . but planning an event , especially a small , intimate one , forget about it . 
 They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile ! 
 Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything . 
 Terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut-down . 
 I 'm no food critic , but I 'd like to think I have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in NY for the last 11 years . 
 That said , I thought Scalini Fedeli was one of the best dining experiences I 've EVER had . 
 From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I ca n't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing . 
 This is , by far , my favorite restaurant in NYC and I only wish it were more affordable so I could go more ofte n ! 
 This was one of the BEST restaurants I 've ever been to . 
 Not only was the food outstanding , but the little 'perks ' were great . 
 Complimentary stuff kept coming , and when the waiter saw me opening a gift , I received my dessert on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it , with a candlevery nice touch , and attentive staff . 
 The menu is Prix Fixe , so be prepared to spend at least $ 60 per person , but it is Well worth itsuperb food . 
 All I can say is WOW ! 
 It 's like you are transported to the Italian countryside , very romantic and filled with antiques . 
 The ceiling is amazing ! 
 I would highly recommend this place to everyone for any occasion ! 
 Scalina Fedeli reminded me why service is so integral to fine dining . 
 While the food was good ( certainly no Il Mulino ) the service was horrendous . 
 Despite the fact that the space is large , they 've overcrowded the floor with tables . 
 My mother and I had our chairs bumped over a dozen times by hasty waiters ... Our waiter was ever so helpful as he stood back and watched my sister and I physically move our table . 
 As soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a chef appeared to usher us out . 
 My entire family was horrified . 
 While the staff at this little bistro is very friendly , I have never experienced more incompetency . 
 Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated , we were served dishes we had n't ordered three times , received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served ( and that order was undercooked ) , and charged $ 45 more than we should have been on our bill . 
 Please save yourself the frustration . 
 When we stumbled on Leon , we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT , we were certainly wrong . 
 The waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet , we were told no...Then , to top things off , she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend 's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes . 
 Such a disappointment ...Rude service , medicore food ...there are tons of restaurants in NY...stay away from this one 
 Leon is an East Village gem : casual but hip , with well prepared basic French bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere . 
 My wife and I always enjoy the young , not always well trained but nevertheless friendly , staff , all of whom have a story . 
 Sit outside in the warm weather ; inside for cozy winter . 
 Decent wine at reasonable prices . 
 Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience . 
 Our teenage kids love it , too . 
 This place is cool enough to be in the East Village , but French enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in Paris . 
 The service is friendly , if not the most prompt in the world , the food is great , and the prices , while not cheap , wo n't put your wallet out of commission . 
 This is probably one of my new favorite places . 
 Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit , but the food was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar ve nues . 
 The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the rasamalai was forgettable . 
 Stick to the gulab jamun . 
 While I quite liked the food and the ambience , I 'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the Michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window . 
 Will go back but only sate those homesick stomach cravings ! 
 My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food . 
 If you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo . 
 It 's very spicy but not offensive . 
 We will definitely go back . 
 Sapphire is the only Indian restaurant I go to when I 'm in NYC . 
 Over the years , it has always provided a pleasurable dining experience with quality food and wine . 
 The staff has always been attentive and kind , and I 've always been amazed at how they 've handled all the various different group sizes that come in . 
 Saturday , Nov. 6th I had a group from work come in with about 35 people and the staff was amazing to accomodate us . 
 All of my co-workers stated that the food was amazing and wondered why they had n't heard about this place . 
 I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fine Indian dining experience that is definitely a value for your dollar . 
 When going out for a nice dinner , I like a nice ambiance as well as very good food . 
 While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in amb iance , and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City , the food was not what I had hoped for . 
 The main course had an average portion , and was decent overall . 
 The bread and lamb chops I had before the meal were quite good , however . 
 The beverages were excellent , and the dessert was good . 
 Still , try it once , since if you end up loving the food , it could be one of your best dining experiences . 
 i've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine , if not good . 
 stick with the chicken , beef , and lamb dishes . 
 i do n't usually order wine with indian so i ca n't comment on their wine list or their wines . 
 instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian . 
 service is friendly , and never had a problem walking in and getting a table . 
 i would recommend reservations on weekends though . 
 skip dessert . 
 I 've lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all . 
 The dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages , sardines with biscuits , large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream ( the best and freshest I 've ever had ) . 
 I 'm glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in NY. 
 I do n't get it , what 's so special about Prune ? 
 not the food ,not the ambiance , not the service , I agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out . 
 Over price , and small portions . 
 Its more of a diner than a restaurant my friends and I will never go back .A WASTE. 
 I have to agree with the previous reviewer . 
 I do n't get it either . 
 Not impressed with the food . 
 Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant . 
 Zero ambiance to boot . 
 With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the food here was decent , not great . 
 The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 ent rees . 
 We ordered the special , grilled branzino , that was so infused with bone , it was difficult to eat . 
 The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic , just simple , small and sparse . 
 Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable . 
 No plans to return anytime soon . 
 I had very high expectations for this place and made a reservation a couple of months in advance for a special occasion . 
 The food is definitely good , but I left a bit disappointed . 
 First , the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials , which I would have chosen had I known about them . 
 When we notified him that he did n't mention the specials , he did n't apologize but let us know that we made a very good decision regardless . 
 Not what I wanted to hear . 
 Secondly , on this night the place was overwhelmed by upper east side ladies perfume . 
 The strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds . 
 they were able to squeeze me in at 6 after i called the night before my anniversary for a friday night reservation and told me they 'd treat us well for the occasion . 
 they did n't disappoint , service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table . 
 all the food was excellent - considering the quality of food in most moderately priced restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it . 
 they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration . 
 good selection of wines ranging from affordable to high end . 
 great experience overall . 
 Yeah , it 's that good . 
 We 've been to Grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed . 
 While the room is not particularly comfortable , once you 're seated you 'll forget about everything except what 's on your plate . 
 Solid wine list , knowledgeable staff , friendly owners and an adventurous , ever-changing menu keep us coming back . 
 This place was not ALL THAT ! 
 There was no ambiance . 
 It was tiny and I felt like I was eating in someone 's living room . 
 The overall feeling of this restaurant was AWK WARD! The food was just ok . 
 And a little too pricey to be just ok . Very few wines by the glass and a small menue . 
 The neighborhood was nice though so check out another restaurant instead . 
 I was so sad to read the bad reviews this place got ! 
 I 've been several times and am totally smitten . 
 It is sometimes a little cramped , and can get a little warm , but hello , it 's NYC ! 
 They also have a back garden open in the summer - cute and French with outdoor seating - what more could you ask for ? 
 Le Pere Pinard has a $ 15 pre-theater menu that is outstanding . 
 Fresh , authentic , french cuisine in substantial portions . 
 Three courses - choices include excellent mussels , puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing , and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world . 
 Their wines by the glass are a great accompaniment and you can eat like a king with wine for under $ 30 . 
 Not a small feat for good french food in the area . 
 It 's easy to get a table for a large group and you do n't get hustled out . 
 Get there before 7pm . 
 Good French restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you 're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at Katz' Deli , or Mexican food which is supplied by capable restaurants . 
 Nice amb iance , nice little bar , good bartender , Francois , and good service . 
 Bill a little high , but worth it . 
 Would definitely visit again . 
 Recommended . 
 First went here to enjoy their garden terrace . 
 The food was amazing , and the service was prompt and help ful , but not over-bearing or rushed . 
 The Steak Tartare is a great bet , they fix it for you at the table . 
 Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm . 
 Great wine selection , Gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value . 
 It may be a bit packed on weekends , but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area . 
 Have recommended the place to friends , always gets good response . 
 The food was actually aweful . 
 I 'm not picky - but it was actually gross . 
 The mussles were the fishiest things I 've ever tasted , the seabass was bland , the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese , the penne w chicken had bones in it ... It was disgusting . 
 Would n't recomend it for dinner ! 
 My girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite . 
 Upon entering , we were greeted by the owners , Steven and Frederick , who went out of their way to be more than gracious hosts . 
 The food was del icious , the atmosphere was relaxed , and we have now adopted Plate 347 as our Secret on Second ! 
 Last time I went here , the waitress did n't come back after taking our order . 
 We did n't get drink refills and she did n't even offer us the option of dessert . 
 My steak au poivre was one of the worst I 've had . 
 The steak was very fatty and the sauce was overpowering and not very tasty . 
 I liked this place the first time but doubt I will ever return . 
 delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere . 
 Kind , attentive wait staff . 
 I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi ( on saffron risotto-yum ! ) . 
 My friend devoured her chicken and mashed pota tos . 
 Delicious crab cakes too . 
 Even if the food was n't this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and rel a x . 
 Great neighborhood joint . 
 Perhaps the last reviewer ( who stated she was treated with attitud e ) lives in a parallel universe because I have never had anything but a perfect experience at Yasuda . 
 The staff is courteous and friendly . 
 More important , the sushi rivals the best in Tokyo . 
 The fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef ( usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt ) . 
 Admittedly , this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate ( and thank goodness , in my opinion ) but for simple , elegant sushi there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US. 
 we were seated at the sushi bar in front of yasuda . 
 there 's a ton of different types of fish here , helpfully organized by group ( salmon , whitefish , tuna , yellowtail , oysters , eel , uni , etc . ) . the fish is amazingly fresh , having been flown in that same day from all over the world . 
 there 's a ton of different types of fish here , helpfully organized by group ( salmon , whitefish , tuna , yellowtail , oysters , eel , uni , etc . ) . the fish is amazingly fresh , having been flown in that same day from all over the world . 
 hes a very entertaining gregarious man , who , despite having fingers like sausages , manages to create perfect bite-sized pieces of sushi with the perfect combination of fish . the best way is to sample at least two fish from the same category ( eg . 
 uni from maine vs california , sea vs freshwater eel ) to get a good taste comparison . 
 if you 're looking for perfect traditional sushi , go here - if you 're looking for interesting combinations , try sushi of gari 's ( east side ) . 
 We were treated with attitude ever since the moment we stepped into the restaurant ! 
 Our first greeting when we entered was The last call is at 10:15 . 
 After we got our sashimi order , I could not believe how small the portions were ! 
 I would not have been so disappointed with the portions if the qualities were good enough to make up for it , but they were not ! 
 I am a 100 lb girl , had a glass of wine and a glass of beer prior to the dinner , and I was still HUNGRY after my visit to this place ! 
 Oh , do n't even let me start with how expensive the bills were ! 
 My husband and I have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar ( chef Yoshi ) and ordered everything ala carte . 
 My goodness , everything from the fish to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing . 
 We 've never had any problems with the staff but maybe we 've been lucky ? 
 In any event , even though its a bit on the pricey side , we still love this restaurant and will definitely go back . 
 I 've been here twice now . 
 The first time the sushi was outstanding , the second time it was a little bland . 
 I 'm sure I 'll return for a final judgement tho . 
 HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE ! ! ! I have read numerous reviews on this place , quoting what great Chinese food they have . 
 This is my fourth try over a two year period , and I 'm done . 
 ( I 've ordered from the 2nd ave . 
 location twice , and the Hell 's Kitchen location twic e . ) The spicy eggplant was DOUSED in oil , the chicken was dry , oily , and tasted like bad chicken from Chinatown . 
 The Singapore Mai Fun had NO curry flavor whatsoever . 
 Do n't waste your time , or money ! ! 
 As I made the title , it 's an affordable restaurant for great taste . 
 I usually order Fried Rice , Shrimp with Sichuan Sauce , some appetizers cooked with Sichuan peppers ... Mmmm ! 
 Staffs are not that friendly , but the taste covers all . 
 I do not recommend lunch specials just because it tasts the same with other regular chinese restaurant . 
 Try ordering from the regular menu , then you would not regret ! 
 We 've only eaten in the restaurant once , but we have ordered many times for dinner . 
 We have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip , and the food was delivered quickly , but we live only a few minutes walk from them . 
 We usually just get some of the dinner specials and they are very reasonably priced and very tasty . 
 I 've had the chicken with garlic sauce , chicken with black bean sauce , and hunan chicken . 
 All pretty good . 
 Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer . 
 We , there were four of us , arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude . 
 They never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table . 
 The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny . 
 After all that , they complained to me about the small tip . 
 Avoid this place ! 
 Once you step into Cosette , you 're miraculously in a small , off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro . 
 This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets , with that certain Parisian flair . 
 The food was average to above-average ; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive , and the desserts not brilliant in any way . 
 However , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world ! 
 Look elsewhere . 
 Go only if you are already in the neighborhood and do n't want to bother going farther for a better place . 
 The appetizers are just OK and the main courses were decidedly subpar . 
 Worse of all , $ 60 was erroneously added to our $ 80 bill . 
 You could get a much better dining experience for the same amount of money in a lot of other French Bistros . 
 Authentic bistro ! 
 Finall y! 
 Romantic if you want it to be ( brightly lit ) . 
 Bernard is a great host ; it did n't bother me a bit that he recited the entire menu to my wife . 
 All the food was hot tasty . 
 2 soups , 2 entrees , 4 glasses of wine and one dessert cost $ 110 w a 20 % tip . 
 Go for it ! 
 You 'll adore it . 
 Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most . 
 Service was very prompt but slightly rushed . 
 Food was very good , but not what I would consider out of this world . 
 Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience . 
 Fantastic place . 
 Cute and decorative . 
 A pleasant surprise . 
 Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else . 
 This place started off a little iffy , but is now one of my favorite indian restaurants in NYC ( and I 'm indian , so I should know ) . 
 The food is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flav o ring . 
 I recommend the garlic shrimp , okra ( bindi ) , and anything with lamb . 
 If you were there when it first opened , give this restaurant a second chance . 
 The wait staff is friendly , and the food has gotten better and better ! 
 The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers . 
 The place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints , and has a bar which deserves a mention . 
 While the place is not a hotspot hangout , the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck . 
 While most people can attest to spending over $ 50 on drinks in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing , the drinks here are plentiful and unique . 
 The 'kamasutra ' and 'bombay cosmopolitan' are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time . 
 Oh yes , and if you are a fan of Indian oldies film stars , there are plenty of portraits of Indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls , some of which , I would love to know where they obtained . 
 I love the b posters of famous Indian actors in the prime of Indian cinema . 
 The puke green walls leave a lot to be desired , but the food is very good . 
 Try the tandoori salmon ! 
 Wonderful ! 
 I have never had anything like it ! 
 The palak paneer was standard , and I was not a fan of the malai kofta . 
 The rice portions are gnerally small - and the vegtable of the day - you get 2 teaspoons of it ! the 3 of us were there for hours - at least 3- well after we were done eating - and no one bothered us , it was great ! 
 go here for the drinks ! 
 esp. 
 during happy hour ! 
 enough said ! 
 the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm . 
 Ask for Usha , the nicest bartender in manhattan . 
 My fav was the sassy lassi... 
 I have been to Mary 's many times and I like it . 
 However , I do not understand the extraordinary hype about this restaurant . 
 I would never wait for a table to eat , it just is not THAT great . 
 The food is good , but very expensive for the casualness of it . 
 Shocking that sides of vegies are $ 6 . ... that is what I would expect to pay in a more upscale restaurant . 
 The service is spotty , sometimes really friendly and sometimes barely there . 
 Some servers make you feel like they are doing you a favor to bring you the food . 
 Some servers make you feel like they are doing you a favor to bring you the food . 
 To begin , we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave , when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready . 
 Sure enough , exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly . 
 The waitstaff were attentive , polite and helpful - an impressive feat in such close quarters . 
 And the food was fantastic . 
 From the entrees to the sides to the drinks , everything was creatively prepared yet still simple . 
 I would definitely recommend Mary 's and am making it one of my regular neighborhood haunts . 
 The food is good , I ca n't lie . 
 But the staff was so horrible to us . 
 The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out . 
 We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order . 
 Save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one ! 
 This place is incredibly tiny . 
 They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends . 
 The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive . 
 The food was bland oily . 
 I just do n't understand all the hyp e ... 
 American tourists New Yorkers , get over yourselves ! 
 In China the phrase for a good restaurant is hot and loud . 
 The people with carts of food do n't understand you because they do n't speak English , their job is to give you the delicious food you point at . 
 You can also special order any kind of dumpling ,etc . 
 from an English speaking staff . 
 Also , if you do n't want to sit at a certain table , you do n't have to ! 
 Having discovered Ping 's on the internet , we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the fish tanks that greet you as u walk in . 
 Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters , the tanks at Ping 's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover 's brunch . 
 The dim sum is delectable while the prices are quite easy on the wallet . 
 The service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives . 
 To give you an idea of how good we thought it was , we ended up going to Ping 's three weekends in a row! ! ! 
 I had heard such wonderful things about this place and saw all the awards they had decorated the doorway , so I was excited to have Dim Sum  lunch there . 
 I had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an unattentive . 
 The Dim Sum was so-so , but not spectacular . 
 Based on the reviews for dinner , this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that , but definitely not for Dim Sum again . 
 I was very disappointed with this restaurant . 
 Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away . 
 I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested . 
 Food was okay , nothing great . 
 Chow fun was dry ; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family . 
 I will never go back to this place again . 
 I love to visit Murrays for my bagel fix . 
 They are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service . 
 Do n't expect to sit down inside though , there are only a few tables and they are always full . 
 Try the olive cream cheese or the lox spread on a whole wheat everything bagel . 
 Yum ! 
 Their coffee is quite good too ! 
 Having been a long time Ess-a-Bagel fan , I was surpised to find myself return time and time again to Murray 's . 
 The Bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture , both chewy yet not gummy . 
 Overall , the best bagel in town . 
 . 
 . 
 now if they could only get a toaster . 
 I love Ess-a-bagel , but I live on the west side , so I often go to Murray 's for convenience . 
 Their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a 'special ' bagel experience . 
 Better than the bagel shop on the corner , but not worth going out of your way for , in my opinion . 
 Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place . 
 Good spreads , great beverage selections and bagels really tasty . 
 THE BIG COMPLAINT : NO TOASTING AVAILABLE. 
 I complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted . 
 Murray wo n't do it . 
 Wo n't or Ca n't is not in the service directory . 
 But who says Murray 's is anything about service . 
 So close , but not good enough . 
 We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods . 
 We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods . 
 Why ? 
 They do n't concern much of customer 's health , just want to make money . 
 please do n't fool us . 
 I went to pams with my girlfriend , and i love it . 
 I 've eaten thai many times , and am very familiar with the cuisine . 
 The Thai food is good . 
 Its a nice quiet location to go eat a good meal , relax , be able to talk and have a very good time . 
 The staff are attentive , and have smiles on their faces . 
 A defitely must visit . 
 Went there for an office lunch . 
 The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it . 
 There is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me . 
 Try green curry with vegetables . 
 The quantity is also very good , you will come out satisfied . 
 The service is ok , some of the people did n't get what they asked for . 
 I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food , but my friend who took me there is . 
 He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine . 
 It was wonderful . the salads are del icious , both refreshing and very spicy . 
 We had Pam 's special fried fish and it was amazing . 
 too large for just two people but nothing was left . 
 Unbelievable . 
 The service was excellent and the food was delicious . 
 We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included : ceviche mix ( special ) , crab dumplings , assorted sashimi , sushi and rolls , two types of sake , and the banana tempura . 
 Overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites , but everything was delicious . 
 Definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date . 
 Its a go-to for dates as well as entertaining out of town guests . 
 We always have a delicious meal and always leave feeling satisfied . 
 Do n't leave without trying One Night in Tokyo . 
 I will never visit this restaurant again . 
 Had been sitting with friends for about 2 hours , ordering food all the while , when we were suddenly presented with a check . 
 After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away ( we had n't even looked at it yet , we had full beers yet to drink ) , the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations . 
 WTF ? 
 Glad you have the luxury to throw out paying customers . 
 I have n't been to the other locations . 
 Haru on Park S is simply disgusting . 
 The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale . 
 Quite frankly , this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried . 
 Will never be back . 
 Here 's to the fake fish tanks too ... 
 I 'm from England , and Haru 's was the best I had in NYC . 
 And that 's no mean feat ... 
 My mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant . 
 The menu may be small , but everything on it is delicious . 
 I particularly love their yellowfun tuna and their mussel selection . 
 Monday nights are a bargain at the $ 28 prix fix - this includes a three course meal plus *three* glasses of wine paired with each course . 
 IT is the best deal in town for a Monday night dinner at a fine restaurant . 
 If you love seafood , you would love this place ! 
 I think I 've had some the best meals of my life at minnow . 
 The seafood is amazing , there 's a good wine list , and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises . 
 The combination of super-fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious . 
 Worth the trip from Manhattan . 
 My boyfriend and I have been to The Minnow four times now and we have consistently been impressed . 
 The staff has always been friendly without seeming grating , and the chef has greeted us on a couple of occasions . 
 You get the sense that the people there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice . 
 After reading the posts , I was always skeptical to go to The Minnow , despite living in Park Slope . 
 But on a lazy Saturday night , we ended up going . 
 Because we did n't have a reservation , we could only sit in the back garden , but it was great , secluded and perfect in nice weather . 
 The apps were good , a little pricey for 1 dozen oysters ( $ 15 ) . 
 But the main hit was the whole grilled fish . 
 It was huge , del icious , fresh , and will be the reason we return . 
 Hopefully next time , I will save room for dessert . 
 So I 've never actually been to M proper , but I 've had it delivered a few times . 
 Even upon delivery , their juicy pork buns are quite good . . 
 .the best I 've found outside of the Chinatown masters . 
 My wife and I also enjoyed the spinach , the Shanghai low mein , and other attractions . 
 The crispy chicken was n't for us , though . 
 Unfortunately , the food is outstanding , but everything else about this restaurant is the pits . 
 They are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine , so if you want to make a reservation you are limited . 
 Then , IF they answer the phone , you 're lucky if they do n't hang up on you ! 
 Walk-ins are risky too . 
 Good to find a restaurant where the owners have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off , like in this case . 
 I have eaten there 3-4 times and the food was always good . 
 One of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way . 
 And comparing it to the Chinatown restaurants is simply not fair . 
 There is not a single place in Chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here . 
 One of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood . 
 This is n't your corner Chinese food takeout . 
 May , the owner always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you . 
 Try the spicy wontons and the salt pepper shrimps . 
 They 're terrific ! ! 
 Each bite of food at Kai was indeed del icious , fresh , and elegant . 
 I had the black cod with yuzu sauce , which was wonderful . 
 I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small ( especially the appetizers ) , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer ( 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing ) , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal . 
 If you are someone who appreciates simplicity , elegance , and wonderfully presented and tasting seafood and vegetables regardless of portion size , Kai is your place . 
 If you are someone who appreciates the same things but hope to have food to spare or share , Kai may not be the best option . 
 The ambience is very calm and quiet . 
 Sake collection was excellent ( Try Nanbu Bi jin ) , but pricy . 
 Not too crazy about their sake martini . 
 Most people eat there seem to be typical Upper East Side snobs , so be aware . 
 Again , the waitress was awesome . 
 She gets 10 for her excellent service and advice . 
 We just ate at Kai and were disapointed . 
 The food was not very tasty , the portioins were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant . 
 And the prices were way to high for what you get . 
 Example is the soup which was about 6 oz for $ 12 dollars and the mushrooms where $ 12 for about 1 oz . 
 We generally like good restaurants and eat out often but Kai was way to expensive for what we got . 
 The grilled cheese at home afterwards was better . ! ! 
 All the staff is absolutely professiona l ! ! I sometimes see the waiters do n't have enough knowledge of their dishes . 
 But they do . 
 ( that is A MUST , but not every restaurant can do .. . ) If you want to dine with large party , I recommend to make reservation BASEMENT . 
 There 's nice and quiet , small but enough for 6 ( or more ) . 
 This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area . 
 I had a great experience . 
 Food is great . 
 Service is top notch . 
 I have been going back again and again . 
 We usually go to the Chart House to celebrate a birthday or anniversary . 
 I must say the view of NYC is so beautiful ! 
 Our last time there a few weeks ago was early at 5pm and it was very crowded and noisy . 
 If you do n't mind all that noise then go to the Chart House . 
 The food is very good too but for the most part , it 's just regular food , nothing special . 
 For myself and family we would only go here to celebrate an occassion , I do prefer smaller , quiter restaurants . 
 The view is breathtaking the service is top notch ... the ambiance is wonderfull . 
 The staff offers impeccable service . 
 I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz . of Maine Lobster in it . 
 My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque . 
 I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash . 
 It was divine melts in your mouth . 
 My boyfriend had Prime Rib it was good .We did n't want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of Korbett it was just enough . 
 We had Lava Cake ... we ordered when our food came it takes at least a 1 to make it . 
 It 's cuz it 's so good you need to taste it ! ! ! All in all we 're already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks ! ! ! ! 
 Just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday . 
 If you 've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer . 
 Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening . 
 The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it . 
 Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went . 
 I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window . 
 Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat . 
 The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent . 
 He offers subpar service and has no personality . 
 In fact , it appears he is going to go postal at any moment . 
 Skip this location and go to the one in Soho . 
 There is no excuse for such lousy servic e ! 
 I 'm not sure why these other reviewers are whining so much . 
 The food at this place is 'gourmet ' Indian cuisine . 
 Its not curry in a slurry crap , and regular run of the mill food . 
 The food is excellent and I have found this location at 104 2nd Avenue to be the most consistent with its food and short menu. 
 The best dishes are the 'paneer bhurji' , the ' Baluchi Shrimp Curry ' and ' Chicken Makhani ' . 
 The manager had an uncanny knack of getting the most rare and eclectic music comprising of indian to add to the ambience . 
 However , in the summer of 2003 , it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup . 
 Food is still great and comparitively ine x pensive . 
 Definite go if you 're used to good Indian restaurant food from abroad . 
 the food was undercooked-the sauce watery , and the vegetables raw . 
 and for this i had to shell out a small fortune ? 
 ( not even to mention baluchi 's , most irrtatingly , chages you extra for rice and all and sundry condiments ! ) i do n't think so ! this happened specifically at this location , but it had happened on enough many occassions on several other baluchi 's last couple years for one to conclude that baluchi 's has lost it . 
 go to any corned indian restaurant , and the little india strip along east 6 st rules supreme ! 
 This restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night dinner location . 
 During the course of the past 3 months , the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better . 
 I wish they would change back to what it was before . 
 The food now is inconsistent . 
 after dining at B.O.G over twenty times now , its official ! 
 not only does make the best pizza in NY , maybe anywhere . 
 consistantly great thin crisp crust , inventive topping combinations and the smokiness from what is believed to be one New Yorks oldest wood burning ovens ......like in Naples only wood is used for Pizza ! as for the rest of the menu , this is much more than a pizza place ...offering such creative dishes like prosciutto sushi .....brooklyn caviar and brick oven shrimp . the salads are huge and well made and the pasta 's are not the normanl red sauced slop you recieve at other pizza houses . 
 brick oven gallery is My pick for best pizza restaurant anywhere . 
 - the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes , however be warned that the Peter 's Favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top , like a salad . 
 It was good , but was not what I thought it would be . 
 - for dessert we split chocolate cake and vanilla gelato ( with espresso ) , which were tasty , but I thought a bit overpriced . 
 - overall , if you are openminded , I recommend it . the tomato sauce on the pizza is a bit sweet and adds a unique touch . 
 I never had anything I did n't like here . 
 The pizza is the best if you like thin crusted pizza . 
 Plenty of choices to make your own creation . 
 The rest of the menu is limited by everything is good eats . 
 Kenny the owner is always there and he treats my family like we are part of his family . 
 We visit at least once a month . 
 This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples . 
 The jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes . 
 The food is amazing , rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza . 
 Best of all is the warm vibe , the owner is super friendly and service is fast . 
 If only they delivered , they 'd make a mint ! 
 This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising . 
 The pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC . 
 Even the pasta is delicious here ( a rarity in New York pizza restaurants ) . 
 I 've been many time and have never been disappointed . 
 Two words : Free wine . 
 I 'm amazed we have n't been kicked out of this place yet . 
 We bring in a party of ten or so every week . 
 Order the panang duck , it 's fantastic . 
 Then , get ripped on free box wine . 
 Tell them Herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter . 
 If you live in Upper Manhattan , Siam Square is THE place for Thia food . 
 While the prices are nothing special , the portions are huge . 
 In fact , two people could really share one plate . 
 The flavors are great , and the menu is extensive . 
 Plus , on Wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited ! 
 if your into thai ..you cannot miss this great restaurant . 
 if you dont even like thai-food ..still go there ..i recommend going there just for the atmosphere and kind people alone . 
 they live up to the thai way of living . 
 you get nothing but smiles and great food at siam square . the jo and bo team equal great times and even better food ! 
 you guys rock . 
 i recommend the thai popcorn : ) 
 For many people , this may not seem like Aunthentic Thai food because most places in NYC arent quite authentic . 
 However , being from Los Angeles and Thai myself , this place reminded me a lot of the hundreds of Thai restaraunts all over L.A. county.The only thing is that the prices are a bit high ( but hey I will pay it to get a taste of home ) . 
 Everything we had was pretty good , but we have only been there once . 
 Its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car ( I happen to live in Inwood ) . 
 But this is the best all around Thai Experience Ive had outside of Bangkok and LA Dishes I recommend : -Tom Yum Soup - Drunken Noodles ( pad Kee Mao ) ( I wil update with more later ) I should be going back this week 
 Downtown Dinner 2002 - Prixe fix : Appetizers were ok , waiter gave me poor suggestion ..try the potato stuff kanish best one . 
 Small servings for main entree , i had salmon ( wasnt impressed ) girlfriend had chicken , it was good . 
 Dessert is a joke ...dont bother 
 it 's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food . 
 I really loved the different and inovated touch that 's the cheff gives to the food . 
 also it 's great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place , the service it 's just perfect ...they 're so frendly that we never want to live the place ! 
 I 've eaten at many different Indian restaurants . 
 But after last night , Spice Grill is the only place I 'm eating indian cuisine . 
 You must try the shrimp appetizers . 
 Even my Indian friend could n't believe how good and tasty everything was . 
 This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time . 
 I cannot imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant . 
 I cannot imagine better Indian food in all of the city . 
 I cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there . 
 Spice Grill is the space formerly occupied by Tiffin , which went bust due to financial fall-out from 9 1 . 
 While the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made Tiffin so attractive , the menu has been overhauled . 
 Meat dishes now adorn the selections , although there 's still a large number of vegetarian-friendly choices . 
 Southern Indian cuisine is still there , too . 
 While this is n't classical restaurant fare , the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely Indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burn-outs . 
 Probably much busier for lunch , it 's seldom crowded for dinner ( too close to downtown ) . 
 Well worth the trip , close to City Hall and downtown subway stops . 
 We had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC . 
 My husband said he could 've eaten several more , the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had . 
 We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful . 
 I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one . 
 We waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right . 
 We will be back . 
 Went here last night and had a pleasant experience . 
 Not cheap , but not that expensive either . 
 Had 1 appetizer , 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was ~$ 55.00 , not including tip . 
 Would recommend this place as a good date spot if you do n't want to drop a ton of cash . 
 Oh , and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough- yummy ! 
 Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood . 
 The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent . 
 The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great . 
 The service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing . 
 The only fallback on this restaurant is the prices . 
 Even though its good seafood , the prices are too high . 
 The lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price . 
 we came here on a crowded saturday night and were seated right away despite being 15 minutes late for our reservation . 
 service was efficient courteous . 
 two of us got the lobster roll ( $ 24 ) while the other two opted for the codfish ( w pea risotto in a carrot reduction ) ( $ 21 ) . the bread on the roll was soft and buttery . the lobster salad was fresh-tasting , but they couldve been a little more generous with the meat . the bay fries were well-seasoned and came with vinegar for dipping ( ketchup available ) . the codfish was decent and fresh ( the reduction was especially interesting ) , but i found the white flesh slightly bland , though the skin was seasoned to perfection . 
 in an effort to increase turnover , the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse . 
 overall , a solid restaurant and at less than $ 40pp ( including wine ) , a solid deal as well . 
 I have been urged by friends for months to check out the mermaid inn . 
 Finally , after all the raving I went to check it out with one of my enthusiastic friends this last Saturday night and let me tell you its all its cracked up to be . 
 We started with lox and mussels ( the best ive ever had , ever ) and had the cod and trout for dinner . 
 All of it was simply amazing , unique and tasty and best of all it did n't break the bank . 
 The staff was knowledgeable and full of personality . 
 From the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed . 
 All in all a wonderful experience , ca n't wait to come back . 
 We have tried every Thai restaurant between Atlantic Avenue and 4th Streets , and Joya is the best . 
 The freshest , best variety , and the fastest delivery . 
 Also very ine x pensive . 
 A great choice at any cost and a great deal . 
 I do n't know about you guys , but when I go somewhere to eat I go for the food not for the atmosphere . 
 I 'm just reading some of these reviews and its nonsense that people are reviewing some places because it was too loud . 
 Please ... are you saying that the food is bad but I 'll go back there because the atmosphere was good . 
 No you 're going to go back because the food was good . 
 So all I 'm trying to say is this restaurant is by far the best thai food restaurant I 've ever been to . 
 The best Chicken pad tai , I 've ever had . 
 And forget what you read under me , the atmosphere is n't that bad either . 
 I 've been to Joya twice and I will never go again . 
 Both times we waited well over a half hour for a table ( even though we had reservations ) . 
 It is LOUD , HOT and DARK. 
 You can barely see who you are with never mind have a conversation . 
 It takes forever to get a drink and they almost always forget to bring something ( although they dont forget to charge you for it . 
 I HATE HATE HATE this place . 
 Joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful - if not relaxed - atmosphere . 
 Now it 's so crowded and loud you ca n't even talk to the person next to you . 
 And everytime I go there 's a bunch of drunk idiots making a scene out front . 
 Get it together . 
 If I wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying customers I 'd go out in Manhattan . 
 I had been a regular due to the consistently good food and ease of getting a table . 
 However , I was there for a work dinner not long ago when my colleague from London noticed a very large waterbug on the ceiling . 
 Then we saw another ...and another ...and the place was really overrun with them . 
 I 've lived in NYC all my life and had never before seen so many waterbugs in one place ( except in a really bad dream ) . 
 The waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but were n't as dismayed or apologetic as I would have expected . 
 As much as I like the food there , I ca n't bring myself to go back . 
 We have lived in Chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant . 
 The food is authentic Italian - delicious ! 
 Pizza is terrific , as is homemade pasta . 
 Ambience is delightful , service impeccable . 
 Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza ( as I love La Pizza Fresca ) . 
 Was surprisingly disappointed . 
 Pizza was a little soggy . 
 Ravioli was good ...but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced . 
 Not enough wines by the glass either . 
 Service , however , was excellent ...and I liked the setting a lot . 
 Food was just average ...if they lowered the prices just a bit , it would be a bigger draw . 
 Eating at Ottimo is like eating in Chef Salvatore Esposito 's home . 
 When he 's not making authentic Neapolitan pizza in the open brick oven or lightly frying zucchini blossoms , he 's visiting the regulars ( a growing legion ) and checking on newcomers . 
 For years , I thought Tuscan cuisine was the best , but Salvatore converted me to the hearty Neapolitan fare on my first visit . 
 His wife Tan ya , the hostess , completes the comforting atmosphere by being delightfully warm and gracious . 
 Great wine list , reasonably priced.--Sara 
 Hart 
 I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever . 
 A gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order . 
 When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not Mcdonald 's , every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude . 
 The service was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald 's than this joint . 
 Never again ! 
 This is a great Thai restaurant with a very friendly staff . 
 The prices are about $ 9 for an entree for dinner and even less for lunch . 
 The food always tastes fresh and served promptly . 
 I recommend their Pad See Ew , Pork Chops or Tofu plates . 
 The prices and ambience are especially great considering it 's in the West Village . 
 There is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner . 
 Everyone I bring here always loves it . 
 We always get a sampling of appetizers and share . 
 The staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table . 
 We go often . 
 The food is nothing like its menu description . 
 The curry chicken I ordered was way too oily and bland ; I hardly tasted any curry or coconut , which they said it contained . 
 It 's like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it ( the sauce was translucent and red ) . 
 My friend 's food was also the complete opposite of what it 's supposed to taste like ( aND look like ) . 
 Anyone who ever dined at a thai restaurant is in for a huge disappointment . 
 Stay away from this place . 
 All the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the chefs . 
 The lunch special is an asbolute steal . 
 Service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things ( the heavy , black , antique-seeming teapot , for one ) in the restaurant experience . 
 After reading the good reviews of this restaurant , I decided to give it a try with two friends . 
 Similar to other Indian restaurants , they use the dinner special to attract customers at the door . 
 However , once we sat down , they only gave us their regular menu. 
 They did n't give us the dinner special until we asked for it . 
 Maybe it was just an unintentional mistake but I 've experienced the same with other restaurants so I do n't appreciate such practice . 
 Food is average , and I would say even the chain restaurant Baluchi 's tastes better . 
 The ambience is very romantic and definitely a good place to bring a date . 
 I would n't mind going back some time , but not before trying others nearby . 
 I have tried literally every restaurant on curry row . 
 Taj Mahal offeres gret value and great food . 
 a friend and I went there for dinner one sunday and were pleasantly surprised ( as she had embaked on the quest to try all the reastaurants with me . ) the waiters work together to serve you quickly without making you feel rushed . the food is spicy by nature ..l . 
 BE CAREFUL before you request extra spice . 
 our entire experience was nice , adn though we got the $ 7.95 special , we got unlimited papadam and tea( even free beer ) just by asking . 
 we did notice however , that some tables had what looked like pita instead of naan . 
 if this happens , just ask for real naan . 
 being a fan of spicy ethnic foods , indian included , i made friends with this place long ago . 
 and never strayed . 
 head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st , taj mahal is also very comparable , in food quality , to the much overpraised ( and underdeserving ) baluchi 's . 
 at taj , vegetarians can rejoice-all the dishes are manna from heaven . 
 carnivores too , can sample succulent tikka masala and all the tandoori dishes ...yummy ! 
 I 've been eating at Taj Mahal for over twenty years and have found them to be the most excellent of the Indian eateries on this block of Indian restaurants . 
 My first encounter happened one friday evening with a friend . 
 We were in search of food and stumbled on this block of Indian restaurants on East Sixth Street . 
 Wondering who had the best deals we noticed a line had formed to wait for this one particular establishment . 
 As there were so many to choose from we wandered up and down the street looking in the windows and such noticicing many empty seats ,except at Taj Mahal . 
 This is where the aforementioned line was . 
 We got in line and were served while in line a bannan fritter . 
 Long story shortened ... the food was plentifuland ine x pensive . 
 For two people with tip was less than $ 25 bucks . 
 The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back . 
 Immediately after we paid , the waiter took the money and said , okay , you guys are outta here . 
 There are other people waiting ! 
 We were n't even at our table for more than an hour total . 
 As we were leaving , the couple standing by the door said to another waiter , we 're not in a hurry . 
 Our friends have not arrived yet . 
 So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary ! 
 For the people who want great food plus great service , Roxy is a place to AVOID ! 
 I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries . 
 I would recommend Roxy 's for that , but not for their food . 
 My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were hug e ! 
 But , they were too big for the bun . 
 Consequently , their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did 'nt feel like finishing them . 
 Also they were $ 15 each ! 
 I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll . 
 It was $ 14 not really bad for a pound of Pastrami-but it did n't have much taste-I 've had better for less elsewher e ! 
 my wife and i have been going to nyc for years and would n't miss roxy ,s food is expensive but it 's new york ! 
 people are rude bit again it 's new york ! 
 get over it ! 
 great food , lt 's of it , more then one person can eat ! 
 Imagine being at the worse deli in the world ....located where it all starte d ! ! 
 The bagel was actually STALE ! ! ! A sandwhich is literally $ 20 and has the worst meat you 've ever tasted . 
 It was so bad I actually refused to pay for my food .

 I have never eaten in the restaurant , however , upon reading the reviews I got take out last week . 
 IT WAS HORRIBLE. 
 The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was n't even fully melted ! 
 It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips . 
 I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst . 
 No , really . 
 I have eaten a lot of pizza here . 
 La Rosa waltzes in , and I think they are doing it the best . 
 The pizza was really good . 
 Although , one night we went it was super cheesy , and another night it was less cheesy . 
 So , a little inconsistency there but either way , both pizzas were really good . 
 And affordable . 
 A great addition to Smith Street : finally , a place that 's not pretentious and filled with women wearing Ugg boots . 
 Oh and it 's too tiny for families with strollers . 
 Leave the kids at home ! 
 ( La Rosa is connected by a swinging door to the Mexican restaurant Pacifico ) . 
 Another welcome addition to the neighborhood . 
 If we were to move from the upper east side , we would genuinely miss this restaurant . 
 We 've lived in the area for more than 8 years . 
 The restaurant is cute but not ups cale . 
 The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes . 
 I would highly recommend it . 
 It 's one of our favorite places to eat in NY. 
 I hate this . 
 Such nice people working here - but I have to review the food . 
 If I could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza , sorry - not the best in NYC . 
 Again , if you are in this neighborhood - by all means , come here . 
 However , it 's not worth a special trip . 
 It 's just O. K. pizza . 
 So sorry I ca n't rate this better . 
 This place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing . 
 When you enter , you feel like you have entered your mom 's kitchen . 
 The service was superb , they treat you like family . 
 I would highly recommend Nina 's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family pictures . 
 We would like to thank Marcelo and Grace for a wonderful dining experience ! ! ! 
 We were on our way back to NJ , and since I am in NY , we figured why not grab some food ? 
 We parked on the block of Nina 's the place looked nice , with people obviously enjoying their pizzas . 
 We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there , sharing a large Pelligrino , a pizza of two of their specials , one was goat cheese the other blue cheese , and both were excellent . 
 We also had shared a house salad that was fresh . 
 We would return to this place again ! 
 You cannot go wrong with this place . 
 The food is outstanding and the service is quick , friendly and very professional . 
 Always a nice crowd , but never loud . 
 Go here . 
 Good for dates or with friends . 
 Horrible . 
 We were seated and ignored by waits taff . 
 Restaurant was dirty and unkempt . 
 Bartender was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar . 
 When he finally did , he was unable to make a gin and tonic -- could n't find tonic . 
 Chance is a joke . 
 Avoid at all costs . 
 My friends and I were on vacation in NY and was referred to Chance by a friend . 
 I found the food to be outstanding , particulary the salmon dish I had . 
 I also ordered the Change Mojito , which was out of this world . 
 My friends settled for rice dishes , but we came back the following day to try the dim sum , which was good ...not outstanding , but good . 
 We ate out in the back patio , which is worth it as it 's cool and the music is hear well there . 
 Overall , excellent restaurant ! 
 This lovely French-Asian fusion restaurant stands out amongst other great restaurants on Smith Street . 
 We walked in on a Wednesday night and were seated promptly . 
 The service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the cod with pineapple tempura . 
 And they provided a delicious dessert on the hous e ! 
 Definitely not a restaurant to skip ! 
 Chance is a small cozy restaurant , with a romantic feel to it , the decor is great . 
 Yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken . 
 But when you are seated the waitresses are great , they explain everything on the menu , and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get . 
 I had the mango chicken and i ca n't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beatiful . 
 Please if your thinking about it go , and stay the wait you wo n't be disappointed . 
 First the wrong bread came out with the appetizer , then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course ... 
 The only thing I could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table . 
 The staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check . 
 At $ 30 dollars for a dinner for one ... you 'd be better off going somewhere else . 
 Everytime my husband and I go there , we are never disappointed . 
 The wine is always good , the tapas are always yummy , especially with the warm pita bread . 
 The wine and cheese plate are plentiful and ca n't wait to try the fondue or table grilling . 
 If you are going out with friends and want some apps and wine and great service then you have to try this place . 
 I loved this place ! ! 
 I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded . 
 The food was very good , a great deal , and the place its self was great . 
 The wait staff is very freindly , they make it feel like you 're eating in a freindly little european town . 
 They forgot a sandwich , did n't include plastic forks , and did n't include pita with the hummus platter . 
 Also , the sandwiches ( n earing $ 7 ) did n't come with anything like chips or a side . 
 Overall , not worth the money . 
 Eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it 's a very disappointing experience . 
 Took my sister here before attending a show one evening . 
 It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant , with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender , but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere . 
 We could only get through an appetizer and cheese fondue . 
 Will have to return to try the chocolate ! 
 I love the tongue sandwiches , grilled hotdogs potato latkes w apple sauce . 
 But do n't ever order bacon late at nite ( either platter or in sandwiches , for that matter do n't from any take out place ) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos , hurt my molars . 
 otherwise , good stuff for late nite eats . 
 black white shakes came out good also . 
 sandwiches tho pricey are over stuffed - can serve 2 persons easily thus cost effective ! 
 Unlike other places in NYC where the sandwiches you want only come as a triple-decker , here you can get what you want in a reasonably-sized portion ( and price ) . 
 The corned beef and pastrami are excellent , much less fatty than those big tourist places around Times Square . 
 The menu has lots of options : I hope to go back to try those potato pancakes . 
 Lunch came with pickels and slaw , no extra charge . 
 It seems like this is a place the locals like and the people working here liked it too . 
 Late nite omelletes are not good here , there is no variety ! 
 They came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant . 
 They used shredded cheese on top ! 
 I will not be coming here at 3am again . 
 Nice place though . 
 Was there Friday night . 
 Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous . 
 And I 've been to many NYC delis . 
 My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it . 
 Price no more than a Jersey deli but way better .
